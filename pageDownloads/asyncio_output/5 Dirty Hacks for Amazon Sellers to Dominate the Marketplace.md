![Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header.png)

## **Amazon Traffic Hack #1 ‚Äì Winning the Buy Box**

Truthfully, the biggest *tip for selling on Amazon* that you need to know is how to win the Buy Box. so this is a crucial part of [successfully selling on Amazon](https://startupbros.com/how-to-sell-on-amazon-fba/), especially if you‚Äôre not [creating and manufacturing your own products](https://startupbros.com/private-label-manufacturers/).

Here‚Äôs an example of what it means:

![Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Win-Amazon-Buy-Box-1024x581.jpg)

Look, of the 20 sellers for this product, only 4 of them are shown on the product page. You can bet that these four sellers are getting most of the sales for this listing‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre one of the 16 losers for this product, what could you do to win the Buy Box?

### **Important Buy Box Metrics**

First, let‚Äôs take some time to review known Buy Box metrics. They can basically be grouped into three categories. For reference, you can see the first page of sellers for the kettlebell listing above, shown to your right.

#### **Pricing**

Understand, this is without a doubt the most important Buy Box metric.

So even though the image of the product listing above says that there are other offers ‚Äúfrom $15.65‚Äù, closer inspection of the listings reveals that those cheaper options are actually more expensive once you take shipping into account.

![Amazon-Price-Page-Listings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Price-Page-Listings](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Price-Page-Listings.png)

By default, Amazon lists products on this page in order of Price + Shipping, and that carries into the Buy Box unless one of the other metrics are way out of whack.

#### **Shipping Performance**

Normally, Amazon puts an enormous priority on fast, hassle-free shipping for their customers. That‚Äôs why they encourage sellers to use their Fulfilled by Amazon program.

And, shipping performance includes a number of individual metrics, including Order Defect Rate (ODR) and Perfect Order Percentage (POP), both of which we talked about in our [last post on Amazon ranking factors](https://startupbros.com/rank-amazon/).

* **ODR**¬†(Order Defect Rate) is how many orders are canceled, returned, shipped improperly or get negative feedback for any reason.
* **POP**¬†(Perfect Order Percentage) is how many orders go perfectly smoothly without any customer intervention.

Therefore, Amazon keeps track of [how often you run out of stock](https://startupbros.com/amazon-inventory-management/), so try to maintain a 100% in-stock rate.

#### **Seller Rating**

It seems to me that the magic number for the seller rating is 90%.

Now the listings shown to your right are a great example. Every seller on the first page has a 90% rating or above. However, you can see that a seller with a 90% rating has a higher Amazon seller ranking than a 100% rating.

It seems that as long as you hit 90% positive feedback, anything extra won‚Äôt have a huge impact on the Buy Box. Giving the most accurate and informative [product descriptions](https://startupbros.com/amazon-product-descriptions/) is the best way to have a happy customer. If your product is not exactly or better as described then the customer won‚Äôt be happy and unhappy customers tank your ratings.

Conversely, it‚Äôs uncommon for a seller with a <90% rating to have the Buy Box.

## **How to Win the Buy Box**

What are the specific steps? Turns out, there are only three:

**1. Make sure you‚Äôre eligible** ‚Äì Your product must have the same ASIN as the listing you want to be featured on (more on this below). You also must meet all the criteria listed above.

**2. Lower your price** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre eligible, pricing is pretty much the sole determining factor. All you have to do is find out what your competitors are selling your product for, and offer to sell and ship it for one cent less. Voila, you rank higher in the Buy Box.

![Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box.jpg)

**3. Use** **Fulfilled By Amazon** ‚Äì You‚Äôll get a special orange Fulfillment By Amazon icon (see above) on your seller listing when you use FBA. You‚Äôll also be able to compete on Amazon Prime listings, which is reason enough to join by itself. Plus, Amazon is constantly trying to push sellers onto FBA, so the sooner you hop on the bandwagon, the more rewards you‚Äôll reap.

(NOTE ‚Äì While lowering the price is certainly a good strategy to rank higher, it is not always a good long-term business strategy. You do NOT want to compete on price alone, as this will only start a price war/race to the bottom)

One of the top sellers you see in the list above is [*WayFair*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/node/index.html/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&merchant=&node=2351444011&tag=httpwwwsparke-20&linkId=53HLPS244W4JYBOJ). As I was poking around Amazon, I noticed them showing up a ton in our searches. They have over 200,000 reviews and this seller clearly knows what they‚Äôre doing‚Ä¶ Just about every item in their shop is winning its Buy Box. Getting [Amazon reviews](https://startupbros.com/amazon-reviews-increased-sales/) has to become systematic to generate sales.

You can see another of their Buy Box-winning products below, shown here from inside their Seller profile shop:

![WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop.png)

![ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header.png)

## **Amazon Traffic Hack #2 ‚Äì ASIN Piggybacking**

If you know the Buy Box hack, your earning potential on Amazon instantly skyrockets. One of the most powerful Amazon tricks you can use is Amazon ASIN piggybacking.

Look:

### How to Find Your Amazon ASIN Number

There are 3 different methods to find your Amazon ASIN number: web address, listing details, or you can use a software tool for ASIN lookups.

We think the fastest way to find the Amazon ASIN is to use your browsers address bar when you find the product you‚Äôre looking to sell.

The [Amazon ASIN](https://www.nchannel.com/blog/amazon-asin-what-is-an-asin-number/) will be after the ‚Äúdp/‚Äù.

![asin-browser-amazon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin-browser-amazon](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/asin-broswer.png)

The next place to find the Amazon ASIN is in the details section of any product listing, near the bottom of the Amazon listing.

![asin-product-page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin-product-page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/asin-product-page.png)

**Now:**

**Steps to Amazon ASIN Piggybacking:**

![asin piggybacking](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin piggybacking](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-ASIN-Piggy-Backing.png)

1. Identify a successful non-unique product and find its ASIN. The Amazon **ASIN is listed in the Product Details section** of the product listing. (shown below)
2. [Research the manufacturer](https://startupbros.com/buying-from-alibaba/) to figure out how you can start reselling the product for yourself. Find out how much it will cost wholesale, and calculate what it will cost you to ship. **Is there room between that number and $0.01 less than the current Buy Box-winning price for you to make a profit?**
3. ***If the answer to and #2 is YES,*** contact the manufacturer and start selling. You‚Äôve just found a gold nugget!
4. ***If the answer to #2 is NO,*** you may still be able to work out a special deal with the manufacturer if you ask for it. However, if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it, look around for other products in the same niche‚Ä¶ Chances are, there‚Äôs money to be made on a slightly lower ranked product.

**Blackhat Amazon ASIN Piggybacking**

As you can probably guess, some sellers have developed a blackhat form of ASIN piggybacking. Basically, it involves finding knockoffs of popular products and listing them with the same ASIN as their non-knockoff counterparts.

This works because the process Amazon uses to identify and suspend misleading sellers is extremely cumbersome. The seller whose listing is being illegitimately piggybacked has to [report the seller](https://startupbros.com/report-seller-on-amazon/) and order one of the suspected counterfeit seller‚Äôs products to prove that it is indeed a different product.

It should be noted here that **Amazon doesn‚Äôt have anything against selling cheap knockoffs.** They just don‚Äôt like it when you lie about what it really is or who really made it. So, I‚Äôm not telling you this method because I condone it, but merely to keep you informed doesn‚Äôt Amazon seller. Someday it could happen to you! Know how to protect yourself from having your product listing hijacked.

In order to keep your Amazon ASIN piggybacking above the table, make sure that you‚Äôre shipping the exact same product ‚Äì **with the same brand, SKU and manufacturing code** ‚Äì as the listing you‚Äôre trying to piggyback. You can‚Äôt even use [your own UPC code](https://startupbros.com/upc-codes-amazon-fba/). You have to list the product with the sellers ASIN.

## **Amazon Traffic Hack #3 ‚Äì Custom URL Queries**

![Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader.png)

The other really common tips for selling on Amazon that we had after our last post was for more information on how Amazon uses URL queries for search results and what you can do to take advantage of that.

So to show you what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes when you use Amazon, let‚Äôs start by looking at the URL for a search term you might want to **increase your amazon seller ranking** for. Therefore, when I search for ‚Äústove top espresso makers‚Äù from Amazon‚Äôs home page, here‚Äôs the URL that we get, shown in the image below:

![Amazon-URL-Query-Hack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-URL-Query-Hack](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-URL-Query-Hack.png)

In case you can‚Äôt see, this is the URL:

http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb\_sb\_noss\_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker

If we dissect this URL, it‚Äôs easy to see that the **&field-keywords=** string is what Amazon uses to ID which search results to show. The ***/s/?url=search-alias*** is how Amazon tells itself to query a search results page, automatically sorted by best-sellers.

So, if we‚Äôre building links or promoting this page, we could strip the URL down to this:

http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias&field-keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker

**Quick Note:** For some reason, removing the ?url=search-alias returns a different set of search results‚Ä¶ Not sure why, but either way make sure you keep that in if you want to make it look like someone searched for that keyword from Amazon.

Now, let‚Äôs see what happens when we click on a product from the search page:

![Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack.jpg)

**http://www.amazon.com/Primula-Aluminum-Stovetop-Espresso-Coffee/dp/B001J1L59E/**ref=sr\_1\_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1422041743&sr=8-2&keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker

The part of the URL that‚Äôs bold is all that you need to bring up this product page in your browser. Everything else is there to tell Amazon how the viewer arrived at the listing.

You can see the **&keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker** tells Amazon that I arrived at the listing by searching for ‚Äústove top espresso maker‚Äù.

There are a couple other keyword strings to be aware of. You may have to do some experimenting one your own to figure out specific URL string combinations that delivers the page you want to see, but knowing these queries will give you a great starting point:

**&node=** is what Amazon uses for categories. If you click on ‚ÄúAll Departments‚Äù and enter the Kitchen & Dining category, you‚Äôll get this URL:

http://www.amazon.com/kitchen-dining/b/ref=sd\_allcat\_ki?ie=UTF8&node=284507

Just like with the *&field-keywords=* string, the only part of the URL necessary to tell Amazon to bring us to the ‚ÄúKitchen & Dining‚Äù category is the *&node=* query, in this case **&node=284507**. So, if we wanted to link to this page, you could strip down the URL to this:

http://www.amazon.com/s/&node=284507

**&field-brandtextbin=** is another URL string you‚Äôll want to be familiar with. It‚Äôs what tells Amazon to filter your search by a brand name. Since many customers already know what brand they want, you may be able to use this query for tracking and [SEO purposes](https://startupbros.com/amazon-seo/).

To bring everything we‚Äôve learned about custom URL queries together, let‚Äôs say we wanted to bring up the search results page for the term **‚Äúespresso maker‚Äù** in the **Kitchen & Dining category**, filtered by the **Breville brand**. Here‚Äôs what the URL would look like:

http://www.amazon.com/s/&field-keywords=espresso&20maker&node=284507&field-brandtextbin=breville

One important thing to note here the use of the *&20* character instead of the *+* character in the URL. This tells Amazon to separate your keywords with spaces instead of actual plus signs.

[The Best Way to Optimize Your Listings with the Right Keywords](https://startupbros.com/optimize-amazon-fba-keywords/)

### How to Use the Custom URL Queries Hack

You may remember that Amazon keeps track of which products people end up buying after searching for a given keyword. They then use that data to help them decide which products are most relevant to the original search term.

This means that you can drive traffic to a product page from [instagram](https://startupbros.com/how-to-make-money-on-instagram/), facebook, or google using a custom URL and make Amazon think all those people came from a search result for your target keyword or brand. That way, every sale you make from that link counts toward that specific search term‚Äôs relevancy!

Make sense? No? Don‚Äôt worry, here‚Äôs a real-life example:

Let‚Äôs say you want to make this product rank higher for the ‚Äúbest espresso maker‚Äù keyword in the ‚ÄúBreville‚Äù brand:

![Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks.jpg)

You could theoretically make Amazon think that every visitor to this page came from the search page for ‚Äúbest espresso maker‚Äù, filtered to the Breville brand, by directing traffic to this URL:

Now, every purchase a visitor makes through that link would count as coming from our target search term, ‚Äúbest espresso maker‚Äù.

Keep in mind, this isn‚Äôt 100% proven to work, but everything we know about Amazon‚Äôs ranking algorithm tells us it should. Plus, the absolute worst-case scenario is that you‚Äôre driving extra sales to one of your products‚Ä¶ Amazon isn‚Äôt like Google where they‚Äôll punish you for trying to optimize for their search engine.

###### Quick way to use the Custom URL Amazon Traffic Hack

By the way, if you‚Äôve got lots of capital, you can fast-track this process yourself:

1. Search for a term you want to rank a product for
2. Click on your product
3. Buy it
4. Change your IP (make sure to clear your cache) or get on a different computer.
5. Repeat!

Of course, if you had that much capital ‚Äì it may be better to spend them on Amazon Product Ads üôÇ

## **Amazon Traffic Hack #4 ‚Äì Vendor Powered Coupons**

If you‚Äôre an Individual Seller with a Pro Merchant account, a Professional Seller or a Vendor, then you can use Amazon‚Äôs built-in promotion tools. The savviest of shoppers always make use of Amazon‚Äôs daily deals.

You can access these deals for yourself by clicking on the today‚Äôs deals link in the top-most navigation menu next to the Amazon logo (underlined in green below). That link will take you to a page like this:

![Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page.png)

As you can see, this section of Amazon‚Äôs website is almost a department unto itself. Promotions are given their own unique links and listing pages. The part I‚Äôd like to draw your attention to is the Coupons link, highlighted in the blue box above. This page takes you to a list of Amazon‚Äôs most popular Vendor Powered Coupons (VPC) in a variety of categories. See the page for yourself below:

![Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons-1024x865.jpg)

Scrolling down the page, we see coupons for Outdoor Gear & Clothing, Grocery & Gourmet, Baby, Household Supplies, Electronics, Personal Care Appliances, Kitchen, Industrial & Scientific, and Other Coupons. There are coupons categories for just about *everything* except for digital content!

Here‚Äôs what a coupon page looks like:

![Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page-1024x477.jpg)

(Note: you won‚Äôt see this page if you‚Äôre signed into Amazon; instead the coupon will automatically be added to your cart)

And depending on your seller status, you can create your own VPCs for [any products you sell](https://startupbros.com/what-to-sell-on-amazon/).

#### Tricks to Selling on Amazon Using Vendor Powered Coupons

Here are four straightforward ways to make the most of your VPC promotions:

1. **Promote VPCs just like you‚Äôd promote any other Amazon product listing.** Coupon pages have their own independent sales rank. So, if you‚Äôre a new seller or trying to compete in a tough niche, you may be able to get more eyes on your product by promoting a coupon for it instead of the listing itself.
2. **Create a bigger discount or coupon than your competition.**¬† Since Amazon tries to give customers the best possible deal, you only need to offer a *little bit* better of a coupon than your competition to maximize your chances of getting showcased on the Coupons page.
3. **Promote your VPCs on third-party deals sites.** This is a really sweet hack that can get you decent levels of traffic with very little effort. Simply [search Google for ‚Äúsubmit a deal‚Äù](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22submit+a+deal%22) and you‚Äôll get a list of 500,000+ websites that all want to showcase your deals. Submit your coupons to 10 of these sites per day because not all of them will take online coupons. And *if your deal is eye-catching enough,* you should start seeing some steady traffic flowing in.
4. **Give your VPCs out to friends and family in exchange for reviews/sales metrics.** This is also an awesome hack, which most of our clients use with great success. You can set up a VPC and discount your product down to your total costs (so you‚Äôre not taking a loss on each sale, but breaking even). Then give this VPC out to friends and family, and have them buy it through Amazon on their own. Most people will be ecstatic to receive such a deeply discounted product, and you‚Äôll get a ‚ÄòVerified Purchase‚Äô review ‚Äì as well as a boost in your initial sales data!

**Important** ‚Äì For #3 to work you really need to offer a standout deal. The penny-pinching you can get away with on Amazon probably won‚Äôt be enough to get you featured on the most popular Daily Deals sites.

So not everybody can make use of these coupons or Amazon‚Äôs other built-in promotion tools. However, if you have the right type of account, be sure to check them out!

**Automation!**

As you continue reading, we‚Äôre quickly going to look at three of the most powerful ways you can automate selling on Amazon.

(check out this overview of the [best Amazon Seller Tools](https://www.smart-minded.com/en/business/amazon-fba-tools/) for automating your sales on Amazon)

**Please note!** This is *not* one of those posts where we‚Äôre secretly trying to get you to buy a bunch of stuff. We‚Äôve found free alternatives where possible, and there are **no affiliate links** anywhere in this guide.

1. **Keyword Research**

One of the most common questions we hear from entrepreneurs transitioning from SEO for Google to selling on Amazon is, *‚ÄúHow do I find good keywords?‚Äù*

Well, the short answer is that there is no built-in [keyword tool for Amazon](https://startupbros.com/amazon-keyword-research-tools/). (But we cover 19 tools you can use there).

##### Amazon Keyword Search Tips

However, you can manually perform keyword research for Amazon.

* **Identify a popular root keyword** in Google‚Äôs Keyword Planner
* **Enter that keyword into Amazon‚Äôs search bar** followed by a random letter (a to z)
* **Get Search Suggestions** for that keyword.

You can see this process in action below:

![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2.png)

It won‚Äôt take long for you to realize that manually finding and recording the Search Suggestions for even one root keyword would quickly turn into a huge task.

What if you had a tool that automated this whole process for you?

### Recommended Amazon Keyword Search Tools

* **Tool #1:**¬†100% free tool that does exactly that ‚Äì it‚Äôs the¬†[KTD Amazon Keyword Tool](http://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/amazon-keyword-tool/). When you enter a keyword, it automatically queries Amazon‚Äôs search box for all the long-tail Search Suggestions for your keyword + each letter of the alphabet.
* **Tool #2:**¬†A premium alternative, we‚Äôve heard good things about¬†[MerchantWords](https://www.merchantwords.com/)¬†(not an affiliate link).¬† They typically use a system that pulls data from major search engines, identifies matching queries in Amazon, and then use an algorithm to combine that data and give you estimated traffic numbers. Still may be worth checking out for some.

2. **Product Re-Pricing**

Using the Buy Box Hack a few times, you‚Äôll start running into a problem‚Ä¶ Your competitors are using the exact same tactics on you that you‚Äôre using on them. They‚Äôll undercut you by a small amount to get placed above you in the Buy Box for your products.

What can you do about it?

### Recommended Product Re-price Tool

Easy ‚Äì invest in a tool that automatically reprices your products so that you always stay on top of the Buy Box. This is almost a requirement when you have lots of products for sale; there‚Äôs just no way to stay on top of pricing for¬†*all*¬†of them.

**Tool #1:**¬† The best one we‚Äôve found is¬†[Sellery](http://sellerengine.com/sellery/)¬†because it‚Äôs a straightforward application that gives you control over when and by how much you reprice your products. Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the interface:

![Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview.png)

**Tool #2:** An alternative to Sellery is [RepricerExpress](http://www.repricerexpress.com/). It does pretty much everything Sellery does with a similarly easy-to-use interface. The perks are that it‚Äôs a flat monthly rate instead of commission-based, and it claims to be one of the fastest large-volume repricers on the market.

(**NOTE** ‚Äì Be careful when using Repricing Tools, and be sure to keep a close eye on all your product prices and repricing errors are not unheard of, and they can be devastating.)

3. **Listing, Inventory & Shipping Management**

Finally, large volume sellers and vendors, especially those who sell their inventory across multiple platforms, will inevitably need a tool to manage inventory and shipping.

### Recommended Amazon Inventory Management Tools

* **Tool #1:**¬†If you‚Äôre an Amazon-only seller, the best tool we can recommend is¬†[InventoryLab](https://startupbros.com/get/inventorylab/)¬†because it‚Äôs an all-in-one inventory management system. You can create product listings, keep track of shipments and inventory, manage income and expenses, and analyze your business‚Äôs growth and performance over time.
* **Tool #2:**¬†Now, if you are selling on Amazon¬†*AND*¬†an eBay (or a NewEgg seller, or one of the other six supported platforms), we recommend¬†[SellBrite](http://www.sellbrite.com/). It sacrifices the accounting, financial and analytics tools of InventoryLab in favor of multi-channel inventory and listing management tools.

For example, SellBrite automatically keeps inventory for your Amazon store, eBay store and Etsy store all synced up so that you‚Äôre never showing duplicate products. You can also manage multiple stores on the same channel (if you have two Amazon accounts, for example). You can learn more about specific features on their website.

## Wrapping This Up‚Ä¶

So, selling on Amazon doesn‚Äôt have to be intimidating, even if you‚Äôre a new seller. It‚Äôs the largest e-commerce platform in the world, and now you have all the tools you need to make the most of it.¬†But in the end, nothing beats getting your hands dirty and actually putting these Amazon ranking hacks to work!

So what are you waiting for? Finally, get out there [buy UPC codes](https://startupbros.com/upc-codes-amazon-fba/) and list your first product! [Start with Retail Arbitrage](https://startupbros.com/retail-arbitrage-amazon/) if you‚Äôre looking for a smaller investment. But take action anyway!

**TL;DR (Amazon Selling Tips)**

* Use the Buy Box Hack by making sure your offer is eligible, accurate, and priced a penny lower than the competition.
* Get easy sales by piggybacking on the Amazon ASINs of successful products.
* Drive traffic to your product pages using custom URL queries to ‚Äútrick‚Äù Amazon into ranking your products for high-volume search terms.
* Create Vendor Powered Coupons if you‚Äôre competing in a tough niche because they‚Äôll have their own independent Sales Rank.
* Automation is the ultimate secret to seller growth ‚Äì identify which tools will help you make the most sales.

Therefore if you have any other Amazon tricks, search tips, or seller ranking hacks, I‚Äôd love to hear about them in the comments below! See you there üôÇ

   Really great job if your aim was to teach the world how to race to the bottom on price so that nobody actually makes any profit (including ultimately, you).

   I know you call out that this \*might\* be a bad idea, but then the whole of the rest of the artice is about how to undercut on price to WIN the Buy Box. Instead the suitable, and not to mention responsible, approach is to MATCH the buy box price and then get an equal share of the sales by rotating through.

       Because amazon has engineered the shopping experience to make you completely anonymous as a seller on the platform. The stores mentioned gain value from returning customers who might buy more profitable items next time or alongside. This effect doesn‚Äôt happen on amazon. You lower by 1 cent, they lower by 1 cent, repeat until both parties are giving the product away at cost. Chris is 100% correct, better to share sales and make $4.00 on 50% of the sales volume than race to the bottom and still end up sharing. If you don‚Äôt have an actual and substantial wholesale cost advantage (which almost never exists), lowering the price is a bad idea.

         This is the nature of arbitrage, it tends to zero. There‚Äôs no reason easy profit should continue to exist for resellers.

           Hey Erik, thank you for checking out the article and reaching out. To directly answer your question, no it‚Äôs not necessary. It‚Äôs an extra space to separate the keywords and make sure the keywords were spaced out and read separately by Amazon. It might have not done anything but we know in this particular situation it worked.

    2 of my listings (in small category) were hi-jacked by an experienced seller (who has over 10,000 seller‚Äôs feedback) last week.

    1. Hi-jacker‚Äôs products have different UPC no.  
    2. Hi-jacker‚Äôs products have different brand name.  
    I only put my brand logo sticker onto product packaging.  
    My brand (trade mark) is still pending status.

    I tried to match the price, hi-jacker still won the buy box, even though I am FBA while hi-jacker is FBM.

    Now, the price is so low that I even cannot pay for FBA fee.  
    All my inventory in FBA is stud. I lost all the buy box once they hi-jacked.

    I removed all photos, description, search term etc. with success.

    But now, I lost the control of my listing. Whatever I did, there is no impact on the listing.

    May be the listing is killed.

    I sent out the message to hi-jacker, no response. Sent the complaint ‚Äì report listing abuse, violation, no response from Amazon.

    I asked friend to help buying from hi-jacker.

    Looks like I am totally stud. Amazon seller support suggests me to remove all FBA inventory to protect interest. I was told even I tried to set up Amazon giveaway, it will all goes to Hi-jacker. But I thought FBM cannot do giveaway.

    Any suggestion?

    Thanks

    Comment on Hack #3  
    By the way, if you‚Äôve got lots of capital, you can fast-track this process yourself:  
    1. Search for a term you want to rank a product for  
    2. Click on your product  
    3. Buy it  
    4. Change your IP (make sure to clear your cache) or get on a different computer.  
    5. Repeat!  
    In testing fba and other aspects of ordering and delivering my listings, I occasionally purchase my own products. Among other things, it allows me to review all of the screens buyers would see through the check out process.

    To conserve capital, I created a promotion of 95% discount. I am the only one who knows and can use the code. I end up receiving my items back at the cost of delivery plus a much reduced Amazon fee.

    Lots of uses for creating sales by buying your own product back if mindful of ip address and delivery address.

    I was wondering if you ever considered changing the structure of your website?

    Its very well written; I love what youve got to say. But maybe you could a little more in the way of content so people could connect with it better.  
    Youve got an awful lot of text for only having one or two pictures.

    Maybe you could space it out better?

    It doesn‚Äôt matter in places you understand it from ‚Äì newspapers, other websites and news sources,  
    whatever. However, every time a blogger does enjoy what he writes about, he‚Äôll probably stick to

    It is very hard to sell your products on the Amazon, specially on the initial stage. I searched for so many ways about how we can start selling on the amazon. Winning the buy box is actually a great idea and I will try this trick for sure. Apart from that getting positive reviews is one of the most important factor to fight with competitors.  
    If I do blogging about my product and give amazon link their, will it improve my product listing?

    I just wanted to know, if you were to repeatedly buy your own product to boost sales wouldn‚Äôt amazon flag that as fraudulent activity? I‚Äôve heard amazons algorithm is capable of recognising these unnatural sales. Also if that is the case how does amazon recognise this?

    Hi there  
    I have a question with regards to selling on amazon and cannot seem to find the answer anywhere!  
    My question is ‚Äì  
    Can I sell two separate products from two different suppliers under one listing with amazon FBA? (just for this purpose I will use a coffee mug and a spoon for example).  
    More to the point can I have two separate products sent to amazon FBA separately and list them under one listing? And when someone purchases the listing, amazon FBA with send both products in the same box to the customer?  
    Would this be correct or am I completely wrong?

    I understand I will have to list the item under ‚Äòbundle‚Äô possibly. Basically I need to know if I can send two separate products to amazon FBA and they will send them both out to the customer as I would like to list them under one listing as a bundle but the products wont arrive at amazon FBA together as they are not from the same supplier.  
    Would really appreciate any comments or advice you have on this.  
    Thank you very much.

      No, amazon will not combine products for you. You need to have the two products delivered to your office/warehouse, package them as a pair in one package youself, barcode the package, and send that to amazon.

    You dont need this extension. Obviously it only works on Chrome and people use other browsers. Just add the item to your cart. Click ‚ÄúCart‚Äù, then +10. Input 999. It will show you the amount that is in stock if it‚Äôs under 1000 units.

    Amazon has not been posting all the reviews people have written, even though we know the reviews were very good, met all the criteria,etc. Amazon sends them a confirmation that their review will be posted, posts it for a day or two and then it disappears. We‚Äôve had that happen about 10 times and we can‚Äôt build our reviews. Any thoughts? Amazon has no answer for us as to why this happens.

For example, I don‚Äôt know what I am buying and I don‚Äôt want to purchase ‚Äúcat in the bag‚Äù from the wholesaler not knowing if item will eventually sell or not. Is there a tool that will help you to see what‚Äôs the sales volume per product UPC on Amazon.

    Also, having multiple accounts on Amazon, all with reputation, I know its against the rules bla bla, but in reality, is this an advantage and higher chances to sell?

    My question is about the book sellers who are posting 50-100,000+ reviews a year. Since only a % of buyers will make a review, the actual sales could be 5x or more than the number of reviews. Amazon won‚Äôt respond to questions about this, but this strongly suggests that there is someway that sellers are spewing out clouds of reviews, positive in all cases. Further, now that Amazon only lists about 5 reviews per page, and does not make searching and filtering possible, then it is easy to bury a negative review.

    Hello,

    I found your article fantastic! I was wondering if you knew of or had any recommendations for any software/website services that allow you to do basically the same thing as your spread sheet with the addition of matching my product identifiers (SKU, UPC, etc.) with Amazon ASINs and pulling not only the fees but Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúCommission‚Äù on that ASIN/listing?

    Basically what I‚Äôm looking for is something where I can retrieve Amazon ASIN numbers and other data in bulk fashion by searching with one of the following identifier types: UPC, EAN, SKU, MPN, ISBN, or Keywords. Gathering FBA fulfillment information including the ‚ÄúComission‚Äù, FBA tier level, order handing cost, pick & pack cost, and weight handling cost.

    I know this may just be a pipe dream but I know there are services out there that allow you to search for an Amazon product based off of the identifier (SKU) and pull all the fees including commission such as Inventory Lab‚Äôs ‚ÄúScout‚Äù feature. Unfortunately their service limits the search to a manual one at a time search which is extremely tedious. It would make sense that if they can pull the data, and have access to all the information that someone would have created a service that could do that in a bulk fashion!

    Anyway I would greatly appreciate your input and suggestions!

    Hey Guys, This is helpful and the article a few ideas I will test. We just left a paid Amazon forum because of too much black hat techniques. Also, if you rely on Amazon as your primary income (as my wife and I have for the past 9 years) trying these things very softly.

    We sell stationery, our own products, so a lot of the buy box does not relate to us.

    But I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone has had our issue: Amazon starting LLC‚Äôs in their category and basically killing our business. Yep, they basically saw our margin was their opportunity (As Jeff Bezos said many times) and they took it to hear. We were a $15K/mo seller now less than $500. And we‚Äôve tried talking to others and NO ONE can tell us what the hell has happened. We tried Amazon Ads, Google, Facebook, etc. The only thing that we came up with is Amazon no longer buys Google PPC. That helped us a lot. But after we paid a programmer to find out how much they were spending, insane amounts, $93,102 per month on our category listings alone. Is it true, we got the data but how accurate, never know I guess.

    Look at this point if you are a $10,000 per month seller we would like to hear from you or even potentially hire you for a consultation.

    I do not know how anyone selling a product that everyone else is and competing on price, FBA fees (btw-they‚Äôve tripled in the past year) can make margin and support a family is beyond me. I guess we are doing something wrong.

    We believe someone hijacked our listings and that hurt. But our sales haven‚Äôt gone back up. Amazon is NO help. I guess we are both seeing some end to this business and wish we didn‚Äôt have to.

    Thanks for any advice.

    Hi Will,

    I‚Äôm an indie author, and I published several kindle books. I do it for almost 2 years and I couldn‚Äôt understand yet how the SEO of the kindle books works. I got amazing (!) verified reviews (from reviewers I send my ebooks to for free) but I don‚Äôt see any purchases. I researched the subject for over two years and I got many bad tips from the net (or maybe I used them wrong :/). In addition, I just tried the Merchantwords (free version) and when I got a term in kindle with 2,400 results the first books that appears have a low sales ranking, while a term with less than 100 searches in the kindle section showed in the first page results books that selles well.

    What am I doing wrong????

    Can you give some (usefull) tips for kindle authors?

    P.S. I Apologize for any gramatical mistakes, English is not my native tounge (My books are translated, but I does the marketing completely by myself).

    Hi

    Enjoying reading all of these great tips. However I too have no luck with the buy box. Been selling successfully for 4 years. Excellent metrics in all areas 450+ feedbacks 99% rating, lowest price etc etc. It seems to me that the only criteria for the buy box is being FBA. I send out myself and therefore no buy box.

    Also I don‚Äôt get this ASIN piggybacking. Surely that‚Äôs a given. You find a successful product and if you have or can source the same item and make money on it then you list it along with other sellers of the item and it is automatically the same ASIN. In fact Amazon doesn‚Äôt like it if you try and create a new catalogue entry for an existing product. Why mention ASIN‚Äôs therefore ?

    I am also a Seller on Amazon, I have found a way that helps me with new product launches. I have did some research and discovered ‚ÄúReview Groups‚Äù with bloggers and I have been doing this for over a year now and I have to say my raiting went up. I can control where they look, what they look out, how much they pay and get a sweet review out of the deal. I find reviews, Key words and Seller raitings are #1 factors when it comes to buying from Amazon.

    I have purchased several things off of Amazon in the past and I disagree that the fulfillment center is fast. The only thing they are fast about is throwing your 5 items in a box, breaking 4 of them and smashing the 5th item.  
    Also I find that the quality of the item is much higher when purchasing from a private seller. Example when I buy through the fulfillment center, I think I am buying a loaf of brand A breads, only to receive my bread and find out it is an old moldy generic brand of garbage.  
    To me it seems that Amazon does not care about the buyer or the seller, since they want to push the most expensive item on you so they get the most profit. Example I you search for a banana, then go to the department they are in so you can search from low price to high price to highest price, more than likely you will find a few pages of the most expensive ones like for 4 bucks along with a few toys, electronics and junk in between, but then when you get to page 208, almost the end of the listing, you will find the perfect one for a penny?  
    I my opinion Amazon has the worse search engine out there and I think people should be informed about their shady sales tactics, or just shop somewhere else. Like I said, I use to purchase a lot on Amazon but it has been 3 years now and I refuse to ever buy another item from there again.

    Is it better to the highest ranking product or the highest ranking product without inventory or very little inventory?

    Hey Guys,

    Wonderful blog post ‚Äì I love your website. I must say I am one of your fans.

    Of course, I have a question about this post :  
    Is there a way to find which keywords people are searching for on Amazon (like you can do in Google)? Or what are the keywords for a particular product? (e.g. hot pot instead of boiling pot). Do you just put those words in the title, description and that would take care of it?

    Thanks üôÇ

    Great article. I have a question about the suggestion you make at the end of Hack 3, where you say you could do this yourself, but it basicly would be very expensive. Are you suggesting you do this for your own Private Label products, to drive your rankings up, or for your own listing for a branded product, so that your particular listing for the branded product ranks high?In either case, you would still have the product, so you could relabel it and send it back into Amazon FBA, so the cost of doing it would be the seller fee and the other amazon fees, right? Am I thinking about this correctly?

      While its good to rank higher for the keyword you would be better to offer a coupon or discount with the aim of also getting a good review. It may cost you a bit more but alot less work and can give them a jazzy URL for keywork and get the reviews.. I‚Äôve heard feedback genius is meant to be good to streamline that area..any reviews??

    Vendor Powered Coupons (VPC) are only for Amazon to use‚Ä¶  
    ex‚Ä¶ Only for Amazon to use with products they buy directly from the vendors/suppliers‚Ä¶. As a product seller you do NOT have the option to use this strategy regardless of whether you ship personally or whether you use FBA.

    I‚Äôve spoken with several people there‚Ä¶

    It could be used to grab & promote as an affiliate I guess, but that is chump change IMO compared to Private Labeling your own product.

    You have brought up a lot of good suggestions and I commend you on your investigative ability.  
    I would like to caution sellers about just piggybacking on listings. We have had many clients over the years that have done this just to get into a bit of trouble. Yes it is nice to be able to find a listing that already has a ranking that is higher than others and just add yourself to that listing, but you have to make sure the listing is complete and has the correct information. Just last week we have had several clients that came to us asking for help in removing negative feedback from buyers complaining that they were not getting what they thought they should receive based on the listing. And they were right, the image showed one thing, and there was no information in the listing (title, bullet points or description) that stated otherwise. Therefore there was no recourse that could be taken on the part of the seller, and you know that Amazon‚Äôs primary focus is on making the buyer happy. Your feedback rating gets too bad, Amazon will take action.

    You had also discussed generic product listings for items that were not a name brand product. Once again this is more tricky than you make it sound. There are many Sellers out there that are working very hard to create their own brand; they have designers, work with manufacturers to make products for them and have spent the time and money to get their brand trademarked. They are not Nike or Black & Decker or Otterbox, but they are brands that are recognized by Amazon through the Brand Registry. Not that many people are familiar with the smaller brands and just seem to think it is fine to attach their generic product to these listings. These are companies that have put a lot of effort into developing a following on Amazon and other marketplaces, just for someone who got a deal on a generic product that looks similar to add themselves to the listing. This not only takes sales away from the Seller who is developing the brand, it has also hurt the brand itself. Comments and reviews from buyers that dislike the product or find the quality inferior negatively impact these brands, but the buyer didn‚Äôt get the brand item that they thought they were buying. Please have your readers make sure the listing is generic and not just a small brand. There are to many Sellers that are mistakenly adding products to listings that are actually brands (even though working with the trademark & copyright infringement group to have these generic products removed from our clients listings keeps us busy) that should be creating their own listings for those generic products and working to affect the ranking instead of taking advantage of the work another Seller has already done.

Or do you do something different? I‚Äôm not sure how to go about listing new imported products as I have only ever sold used textbooks which I piggyback onto existing listings in the used section.

     Thanks for the info. I did retail arbitrage prior to private labeling on Amazon and I found that it was really effective to price slightly higher than the competition. Even if you are a few cents higher but within 1% of your competition (depending on the category) you will share the buy box and possibly avoid triggering their repricer. This avoids the whole race to the bottom and still gets you sales.

             From my experience you will be charged $1.00 or 15% (whichever is higher) as a commission from Amazon. The FBA fee‚Äôs would remain the same.

     Advanced tactics here, thanks for sharing. I‚Äôve been selling on Amazon successfully for 2 years now, and the first couple weeks of a new listing is always the worst. I will try to apply these on our next product launch ‚Äì thank you for sharing!

       Thanks for bringing up that important point Rob.

       There are many other aspects of being a successful Amazon seller ‚Äì but when speaking solely about ranking hacks, price cutting is obviously a big deal. You can instantly go from the bottom of the list to the top.

       I‚Äôll be sure to add a disclaimer that this is solely for ranking your Amazon products well!

     So the main takeaway is that to win the buy box you need to be priced lower than the competition? Isn‚Äôt that a race to the bottom? I thought the idea from previous posts was to compete by selling better: branding products, writing better descriptions, etc

       Maybe I should have made that point #5 ‚Äì I do not believe it‚Äôs the most important Uri! Advanced tactics like the URL Search Query hack and Vendor Powered Coupons are much more effective for new sellers.

       Furthermore, I would not recommend competing on price alone! However, if you‚Äôre playing a pure arbitrage game ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to have to in most cases ‚Äì at least until you can start differentiating your product and brand.

       Sorry for the confusion‚Ä¶

         These have not worked for me. I dont‚Äô know what it is, but I struggle to win the buybox. I‚Äôve lost out on the buybox to sellers with an 82% rating, and I have a 100% rating, and I was priced lower than them.
