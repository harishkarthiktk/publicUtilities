Are you an eCommerce seller wondering what to sell on Amazon and how to select products that maximise your business potential?

Then don’t worry, we have got you covered.

As businesses from diverse industries increase their presence on Amazon to reach customers directly, the platform is becoming a perfect place to sell products nationally as well as internationally.

In this article, we will look into popular product categories on Amazon, share effective strategies to sell them, and highlight common mistakes that new sellers should avoid.

## Factors to Consider for Selecting the Right Product Mix

For new sellers, it is important to know how to choose the right product category to build a profitable business. The right product can help boost customer engagement, empowering businesses to succeed in the [competitive e-commerce space](https://shipglobal.in/blogs/7-trends-in-e-commerce-for-cross-border-shipping-in-2024/).

It’s important to pay attention to various aspects of businesses when selecting what to sell on Amazon.

Some of these factors are:

* Profit Margins: Look into the different costs involved in selling products online.  
  Select products that are easy to package and ship. Did you know that nearly 30% of profits can be eaten up by Amazon fees, shipping fees, and other possible expenses in certain niches?  
  Further, choose products that are non-perishable. Products with longer life span can help minimise loss due to unforeseen circumstances.
* Quality: Choosing high-quality materials will make your products stand out from that of your competitors.
* High Demand Products: Conduct research to identify high-demand products. It is essential for you to know what is trending within the online marketplace.
* Seasonal Items: You can decide if you want to sell seasonal products and items that enjoy high demand during certain times of the year.  
  Pro Tip: Make the most of the festive season to reach a wider audience.
