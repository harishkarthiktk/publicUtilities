# 25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025

16 min read

Amazon’s marketplace processes billions of orders annually, making it one of the most lucrative platforms for entrepreneurs looking to build a profitable online business.

But here’s the challenge: with millions of sellers competing for attention, choosing the right products can make or break your Amazon venture. The difference between a thriving Amazon business and one that struggles often comes down to product selection.

This blog post reveals the best products to [sell on Amazon](https://www.ecwid.com/marketplaces/amazon) based on current market data, profitability analysis, and consumer trends.

Whether you’re a complete beginner or looking to expand your existing Amazon FBA business, you’ll discover proven product categories, specific item recommendations, and actionable strategies to identify winning products for 2025.

How to sell online

Tips from e-commerce experts for small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs.

## What You Need to Know Before Starting to Sell on Amazon

With around [2.2 billion monthly web visits](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623566/web-visits-to-amazoncom/), Amazon presents a great opportunity to find profitable products and scale your business. However, starting an Amazon business requires understanding both the opportunities and challenges that come with selling on the world’s largest online marketplace.

### Pros and Cons of Selling on Amazon

The **advantages** of [selling on Amazon](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-for-beginners.html) are compelling:

* Amazon’s massive customer base means instant access to millions of potential buyers without spending years building brand recognition.
* The platform handles payment processing, customer service inquiries, and returns through its A-to-Z guarantee program.
* Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) manages storage, packaging, and shipping, allowing you to focus on product sourcing and marketing.
* Prime membership creates a built-in advantage for FBA sellers, as Prime customers often filter search results to show only Prime-eligible products. This can boost your visibility and conversion rates.

However, selling on Amazon comes with notable **challenges**:

* Competition is fierce across virtually every product category.
* Amazon’s algorithm changes can impact your product rankings overnight.
* The platform takes a significant portion of each sale through referral fees, FBA fees, and other charges that can eat into profit margins.
* Amazon also maintains strict policies regarding product quality, customer service, and account performance. Policy violations can result in account suspension, making it crucial to understand and follow all guidelines from day one.

![25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Choose-the-Right-Marketplace-for-Your-Business-amazon-statistics-1746700344.png)

In March 2024, Amazon.com received around 2.2 billion total website visits (Source: Statista)

### Understanding Amazon Fees

Amazon’s fee structure includes several components that affect your profitability:

**Referral fees** range from 8% to 15% of the item’s sale price, depending on the product category. Electronics typically have lower referral fees (8%), while jewelry and fine art can reach 20%.

**Monthly subscription fees** for professional seller accounts cost $39.99 per month but provide access to advanced selling tools and bulk listing capabilities.

**Per-item selling fees** are for sellers with an Individual Selling Plan who pay a per-item fee for each item sold in the Amazon store (in addition to any other applicable fees).

A **closing fee** of $1.8 is applied to each media item sold (in addition to any other applicable fees) in these categories: Books, DVD, Music, Software & Computer/Video Games, Video Game Consoles, and Video Game Accessories.

With many sellers exploring the best products to sell on Amazon FBA, it’s equally important to consider the associated fees.

FBA is the service where Amazon handles storing, packing, and shipping your products to customers.

**FBA fees** cover storage, picking, packing, and shipping. These fees vary based on product size, weight, and storage duration. Long-term storage fees apply to inventory that sits in Amazon warehouses for more than 181 days.

So, if you’re looking for the best products to sell on Amazon FBA in 2025, don’t forget to consider the fees, too.

Understanding these costs upfront helps you price products appropriately and maintain healthy profit margins. Most successful Amazon sellers aim for at least 30-40% profit margins after all fees and costs.

For more details, check out the [Amazon fees guide](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G6F7CN3EQS7MEGCN) on the Seller Central Help.

## Identifying High-Demand Products

To answer the question, “What are the best products to sell on Amazon?”, it’s crucial to explore ways to identify product categories that consistently deliver strong sales.

One effective approach is to analyze historical data. For example, during Amazon Prime Day in 2024, 34% of Prime members in the US [bought apparel and accessories](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112952/most-popular-product-categories-purchased-amazon-prime-members-usa/). Another 32% purchased health and beauty products, while 28% chose consumer electronics.

Consider exploring categories that tend to attract increased customer interest, whether seasonally or year-round. Let’s take a look at the examples below.

### Categories with Strong Sales

When looking for the best products to sell on Amazon for beginners, a smart strategy is to focus on popular categories.

The Apparel and Accessories category leads the market but is highly competitive. It may be worthwhile to consider exploring other categories, such as:

**Health and Personal Care** remains one of the most profitable categories, with supplements, skincare products, and wellness items showing consistent growth. The category benefits from repeat customers and higher average order values.

**Home and Kitchen** products can also be considered some of the best products to sell on Amazon. Items that address common household challenges or enhance daily routines tend to perform particularly well. Kitchen gadgets, storage solutions, and home organization products frequently appear on bestseller lists.

**Electronics and Accessories** maintain strong demand, especially smartphone accessories, computer peripherals, and smart home devices. These categories often have higher profit margins and appeal to tech-savvy consumers willing to pay premium prices.

**Sports and Outdoors** equipment benefits from seasonal trends and the growing focus on health and fitness. Workout equipment, outdoor gear, and athletic accessories consistently generate strong sales.

### Analyzing Market Trends

When you stay informed about market trends, you can more easily identify the best products to sell on Amazon.

Consumer preferences shift based on technological advances, lifestyle changes, and global events.

For example, smart home technology continues expanding as more households adopt connected devices. Also, sustainability and eco-friendly products gain traction as environmental consciousness grows.

The remote work trend drives demand for home office equipment, ergonomic accessories, and productivity tools.

Pet products experience consistent growth as pet ownership increases and owners invest more in pet care and accessories.

Seasonal trends create opportunities for strategic sellers, so pay attention to them when looking for the best products to sell on Amazon. For example, back-to-school periods boost sales of organizational products and electronics. Holiday seasons drive gift purchases across multiple categories, too.

**Smartphone Camera Lenses** enhance mobile photography capabilities. Macro, wide-angle, and telephoto lens attachments appeal to social media content creators and photography enthusiasts.

**Pet Grooming Tools** help owners maintain their pets between professional grooming sessions. De-shedding tools and nail clippers with safety features perform consistently well.

### Baby and Kids

**Baby Carriers** support the growing babywearing trend. Ergonomic carriers with multiple carrying positions and breathable fabrics command premium prices.

### Beauty and Personal Care

**Facial Cleansing Brushes** capitalize on the skincare routine trend. Silicone brushes with multiple speed settings and waterproof designs appeal to skincare enthusiasts.

**Nail Art Supplies** benefit from the DIY beauty trend. Nail stamping kits and gel polish sets allow customers to create professional-looking manicures at home.

## How to Find the Best Products to Sell on Amazon

Identifying the best products to sell on Amazon requires systematic research using both Amazon’s native tools and third-party resources.

### Browsing Amazon’s Best Seller Lists

Amazon’s Best Sellers lists provide real-time insights into which products are currently performing well across different categories. These lists update hourly, offering a snapshot of consumer demand.

Category-specific bestseller lists reveal opportunities within your areas of interest. Look for products with consistent rankings rather than those experiencing temporary spikes.

![25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/the-best-products-to-sell-on-amazon-1750940838-1024x638.png)

Discover customer favorites by exploring Amazon’s bestseller lists on the marketplace website

Pay attention to seasonal patterns in bestseller lists. Products that appear regularly during specific times of year can inform your inventory planning and marketing strategies.

New releases sections highlight products gaining momentum. Items that quickly climb these lists often indicate emerging trends worth investigating.

### Using Product Research Tools

**Jungle Scout** provides comprehensive product research capabilities, including sales estimates, revenue projections, and competition analysis. The tool’s Product Database allows filtering by category, price range, and sales volume.

**Helium 10** offers a suite of tools for product research, keyword analysis, and listing optimization. Their Black Box tool helps identify profitable niches based on specific criteria.

**AMZScout** specializes in product research and profitability analysis. Their Chrome extension provides instant data on any Amazon product page, including sales estimates and competition levels.

Manual research techniques remain valuable supplements to paid tools. Monitor social media trends, industry publications, and consumer forums to identify emerging needs and product gaps.

## Validating Amazon Product Ideas

Before committing to a product, validate demand through multiple data points:

**Search volume analysis** using tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs reveals how many people search for your product type monthly.

**Competition assessment** examines the number of sellers, their review counts, and pricing strategies. Look for markets with sufficient demand but manageable competition levels.

**Profit margin calculations** must account for all costs, including product cost, Amazon fees, advertising spend, and shipping expenses. Target products with at least 30% profit margins after all expenses.

**Customer reviews analysis** on existing products reveals common complaints and desired improvements. Products with consistently mentioned issues present opportunities for superior alternatives.
