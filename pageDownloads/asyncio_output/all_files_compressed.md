# 25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025
16 min read
Amazon’s marketplace processes billions of orders annually, making it one of the most lucrative platforms for entrepreneurs looking to build a profitable online business.
But here’s the challenge: with millions of sellers competing for attention, choosing the right products can make or break your Amazon venture. The difference between a thriving Amazon business and one that struggles often comes down to product selection.
This blog post reveals the best products to [sell on Amazon](https://www.ecwid.com/marketplaces/amazon) based on current market data, profitability analysis, and consumer trends.
Whether you’re a complete beginner or looking to expand your existing Amazon FBA business, you’ll discover proven product categories, specific item recommendations, and actionable strategies to identify winning products for 2025.

## What You Need to Know Before Starting to Sell on Amazon
With around [2.2 billion monthly web visits](https://www.statista.com/statistics/623566/web-visits-to-amazoncom/), Amazon presents a great opportunity to find profitable products and scale your business. However, starting an Amazon business requires understanding both the opportunities and challenges that come with selling on the world’s largest online marketplace.
### Pros and Cons of Selling on Amazon
The **advantages** of [selling on Amazon](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/how-to-sell-on-amazon-for-beginners.html) are compelling:
* Amazon’s massive customer base means instant access to millions of potential buyers without spending years building brand recognition.
* The platform handles payment processing, customer service inquiries, and returns through its A-to-Z guarantee program.
* Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) manages storage, packaging, and shipping, allowing you to focus on product sourcing and marketing.
* Prime membership creates a built-in advantage for FBA sellers, as Prime customers often filter search results to show only Prime-eligible products. This can boost your visibility and conversion rates.
However, selling on Amazon comes with notable **challenges**:
* Competition is fierce across virtually every product category.
* Amazon’s algorithm changes can impact your product rankings overnight.
* The platform takes a significant portion of each sale through referral fees, FBA fees, and other charges that can eat into profit margins.
* Amazon also maintains strict policies regarding product quality, customer service, and account performance. Policy violations can result in account suspension, making it crucial to understand and follow all guidelines from day one.
![25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Choose-the-Right-Marketplace-for-Your-Business-amazon-statistics-1746700344.png)
In March 2024, Amazon.com received around 2.2 billion total website visits (Source: Statista)
### Understanding Amazon Fees
Amazon’s fee structure includes several components that affect your profitability:
**Referral fees** range from 8% to 15% of the item’s sale price, depending on the product category. Electronics typically have lower referral fees (8%), while jewelry and fine art can reach 20%.
**Monthly subscription fees** for professional seller accounts cost $39.99 per month but provide access to advanced selling tools and bulk listing capabilities.
**Per-item selling fees** are for sellers with an Individual Selling Plan who pay a per-item fee for each item sold in the Amazon store (in addition to any other applicable fees).
A **closing fee** of $1.8 is applied to each media item sold (in addition to any other applicable fees) in these categories: Books, DVD, Music, Software & Computer/Video Games, Video Game Consoles, and Video Game Accessories.
With many sellers exploring the best products to sell on Amazon FBA, it’s equally important to consider the associated fees.
FBA is the service where Amazon handles storing, packing, and shipping your products to customers.
**FBA fees** cover storage, picking, packing, and shipping. These fees vary based on product size, weight, and storage duration. Long-term storage fees apply to inventory that sits in Amazon warehouses for more than 181 days.
So, if you’re looking for the best products to sell on Amazon FBA in 2025, don’t forget to consider the fees, too.
Understanding these costs upfront helps you price products appropriately and maintain healthy profit margins. Most successful Amazon sellers aim for at least 30-40% profit margins after all fees and costs.
For more details, check out the [Amazon fees guide](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G6F7CN3EQS7MEGCN) on the Seller Central Help.
## Identifying High-Demand Products
To answer the question, “What are the best products to sell on Amazon?”, it’s crucial to explore ways to identify product categories that consistently deliver strong sales.
One effective approach is to analyze historical data. For example, during Amazon Prime Day in 2024, 34% of Prime members in the US [bought apparel and accessories](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112952/most-popular-product-categories-purchased-amazon-prime-members-usa/). Another 32% purchased health and beauty products, while 28% chose consumer electronics.
![25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/best-products-to-sell-on-Amazon-FBA-1750940836.png)

Consider exploring categories that tend to attract increased customer interest, whether seasonally or year-round. Let’s take a look at the examples below.
### Categories with Strong Sales
When looking for the best products to sell on Amazon for beginners, a smart strategy is to focus on popular categories.
The Apparel and Accessories category leads the market but is highly competitive. It may be worthwhile to consider exploring other categories, such as:
**Health and Personal Care** remains one of the most profitable categories, with supplements, skincare products, and wellness items showing consistent growth. The category benefits from repeat customers and higher average order values.
**Home and Kitchen** products can also be considered some of the best products to sell on Amazon. Items that address common household challenges or enhance daily routines tend to perform particularly well. Kitchen gadgets, storage solutions, and home organization products frequently appear on bestseller lists.
**Electronics and Accessories** maintain strong demand, especially smartphone accessories, computer peripherals, and smart home devices. These categories often have higher profit margins and appeal to tech-savvy consumers willing to pay premium prices.
**Sports and Outdoors** equipment benefits from seasonal trends and the growing focus on health and fitness. Workout equipment, outdoor gear, and athletic accessories consistently generate strong sales.
### Analyzing Market Trends
When you stay informed about market trends, you can more easily identify the best products to sell on Amazon.
Consumer preferences shift based on technological advances, lifestyle changes, and global events.
For example, smart home technology continues expanding as more households adopt connected devices. Also, sustainability and eco-friendly products gain traction as environmental consciousness grows.
The remote work trend drives demand for home office equipment, ergonomic accessories, and productivity tools.
Pet products experience consistent growth as pet ownership increases and owners invest more in pet care and accessories.
Seasonal trends create opportunities for strategic sellers, so pay attention to them when looking for the best products to sell on Amazon. For example, back-to-school periods boost sales of organizational products and electronics. Holiday seasons drive gift purchases across multiple categories, too.

## How to Find the Best Products to Sell on Amazon
Identifying the best products to sell on Amazon requires systematic research using both Amazon’s native tools and third-party resources.
### Browsing Amazon’s Best Seller Lists
Amazon’s Best Sellers lists provide real-time insights into which products are currently performing well across different categories. These lists update hourly, offering a snapshot of consumer demand.
Category-specific bestseller lists reveal opportunities within your areas of interest. Look for products with consistent rankings rather than those experiencing temporary spikes.
![25 Best Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025](https://don16obqbay2c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/the-best-products-to-sell-on-amazon-1750940838-1024x638.png)
Discover customer favorites by exploring Amazon’s bestseller lists on the marketplace website
Pay attention to seasonal patterns in bestseller lists. Products that appear regularly during specific times of year can inform your inventory planning and marketing strategies.
New releases sections highlight products gaining momentum. Items that quickly climb these lists often indicate emerging trends worth investigating.
### Using Product Research Tools
**Jungle Scout** provides comprehensive product research capabilities, including sales estimates, revenue projections, and competition analysis. The tool’s Product Database allows filtering by category, price range, and sales volume.
**Helium 10** offers a suite of tools for product research, keyword analysis, and listing optimization. Their Black Box tool helps identify profitable niches based on specific criteria.
**AMZScout** specializes in product research and profitability analysis. Their Chrome extension provides instant data on any Amazon product page, including sales estimates and competition levels.
Manual research techniques remain valuable supplements to paid tools. Monitor social media trends, industry publications, and consumer forums to identify emerging needs and product gaps.

## Validating Amazon Product Ideas
Before committing to a product, validate demand through multiple data points:
**Search volume analysis** using tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs reveals how many people search for your product type monthly.
**Competition assessment** examines the number of sellers, their review counts, and pricing strategies. Look for markets with sufficient demand but manageable competition levels.
**Profit margin calculations** must account for all costs, including product cost, Amazon fees, advertising spend, and shipping expenses. Target products with at least 30% profit margins after all expenses.
**Customer reviews analysis** on existing products reveals common complaints and desired improvements. Products with consistently mentioned issues present opportunities for superior alternatives.
## Start Selling on Amazon

* Posted on August 22, 2024

* In [Uncategorized](https://marketplacevalet.com/category/uncategorized/)
Selecting the right product category on Amazon is more than just a routine step in listing your product—it’s a critical decision that can significantly influence your product’s visibility, customer reach, and sales performance. For third-party sellers, understanding how to effectively navigate and choose the optimal category can be the difference between obscurity and success on this vast e-commerce platform. This detailed guide will explore the nuances of Amazon’s category system, provide strategies for making the best category choices, and offer tips on optimizing your listings for maximum impact.
## Understanding Amazon’s Category System
Amazon organizes its extensive product range into specific categories and subcategories, each with its own set of rules, guidelines, and customer base. The category you select determines how customers find your products through search and browse paths. It’s essential to grasp the hierarchy and characteristics of these categories to position your product accurately.
### Why Category Accuracy Matters
1. **Visibility**: Products in the most relevant category are more likely to appear in search results when customers use category-specific filters.
2. **Conversion**: Customers browsing a specific category are generally further along in the buying process, making them more likely to purchase.
3. **Compliance**: Amazon has specific requirements and restrictions based on category, including different fees, advertising options, and even image requirements.
## Strategies for Selecting the Right Category
### 1. **Conduct Competitor Analysis**
Start by identifying where your direct competitors have categorized their products. Analyzing similar products can provide insights into where your target customers are most likely to search. Tools like Jungle Scout or Helium 10 can be useful for this analysis, providing data on category trends and competitor performance.
### 2. **Understand Your Product Completely**
To choose the right category, you must have a deep understanding of your product’s features, uses, and target audience. Consider the primary function of your product and the problem it solves, then match this to the category that best reflects these attributes.
### 3. **Use Amazon’s Browse Tree Guides (BTG)**
Amazon provides Browse Tree Guides for sellers, which are manuals that detail the category structure and the recommended node for various types of products. These guides can be extremely helpful in determining the most appropriate category and ensuring your product adheres to specific category guidelines.
### 4. **Consider Search Terms and SEO**
The keywords associated with different categories can also guide your decision. Use keyword research tools to discover which terms are most often used by customers who buy products like yours. Integrating these keywords into your product listings can improve SEO and ensure your products appear in relevant searches.
### 5. **Evaluate Category-Specific Benefits and Restrictions**
Some categories may offer special features, like enhanced brand content or promotional opportunities, that can be beneficial. Conversely, some categories have stricter requirements or higher competition. Weigh these factors based on your ability to meet the requirements and leverage the benefits.
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
* **Incorrect Categorization**: Placing your product in a category that does not align with its primary function can lead to poor visibility and lower conversion rates.
* **Overlooking Subcategories**: Sometimes, the main category might be too broad. Explore subcategories for a more precise fit, which can reduce competition and increase relevance.
* **Ignoring Category Updates**: Amazon frequently updates its category structure. Regular checks are necessary to ensure your product remains optimally placed.
## Advanced Tips: Using Amazon’s Tools and Resources
* **Category Listing Report**: Sellers with Brand Registry access can use this report from Amazon to see the categories of their current listings and analyze category performance.
* **Automated Repricers and Analytical Tools**: Utilize tools to monitor how changes in your category choices affect your sales and visibility.
## Conclusion
Choosing the right Amazon category is a strategic decision that requires a thoughtful approach and continuous optimization. By carefully analyzing your product, understanding Amazon’s category structure, and continuously monitoring performance, you can significantly enhance your product’s online presence. Always remember that the goal is to improve the customer’s ability to discover and purchase your products, thereby driving up your sales and business growth on Amazon.
For third-party sellers looking to excel on Amazon, mastering category selection is just the beginning. Embrace the complexity of Amazon’s marketplace as an opportunity to fine-tune your e-commerce strategies and stand out in a competitive field.

Amazon product research in 2025 is no longer guesswork – it's a precise, system-driven process that separates profitable sellers from the rest. Whether you’re scaling a [wholesale model](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-wholesale), sourcing [online arbitrage](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/online-arbitrage-for-beginners) or dropshipping deals, how you research products directly impacts your success.
In this guide, you’ll master two key workflows for Amazon product research: automated bulk research for [wholesale sourcing](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-buy-wholesale-to-sell-on-amazon) and advanced, single-product analysis for high-margin listings. We’ll break down both step by step – from tools and [supplier price list scanning](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/wholesale-price-list) to real-world signals and product validation.
Let’s break down how to move from “just browsing” to building a portfolio of profitable, low-risk Amazon leads.
## What Is Amazon Product Research?
Amazon product research is the process of [identifying items to resell on Amazon](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-find-products-to-sell-on-amazon) that have strong sales potential and enough margin to make them profitable after fees, shipping, and sourcing costs. For resellers, it’s about spotting products that are already selling – not inventing new ones – and [finding reliable suppliers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/12-ways-to-find-amazon-fba-suppliers) who can match the demand.
Without product research, sourcing becomes guesswork. You risk stocking inventory that doesn’t move or competing in saturated niches where prices are in a race to the bottom. Product research helps you avoid dead inventory and discover high-velocity, low-risk opportunities that fit your [sourcing model](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-business-models-how-to-choose-the-right-one) – whether that’s wholesale, [online arbitrage, or dropshipping](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/online-arbitrage-vs-dropshipping-which-business-model-is-best-for-you).
In 2025, Amazon product research is a tool-first process. Manual scrolling is nearly obsolete – data-driven decisions now start with software. Tools like Seller Assistant help you evaluate thousands of [ASINs](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-an-asin), spot hidden trends, and filter by critical metrics like [BSR](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-best-sellers-rank-everything-you-need-to-know), [Buy Box consistency](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-buy-box-how-to-win-buy-box-on-amazon), sales velocity, and brand gating. The game isn’t just about finding winners – it’s about systematically eliminating losers before you buy.
## Why Amazon Product Research Matters
![Why Amazon Product Research Matters](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f0f65bd35a2f99b9a3bd38e/6867cd84aac1624b53ed6962_6867bccd5a798d6e924ad95c_6867a6d600378ea850cba51e_Why%252520Amazon%252520Product%252520Research%252520Matters.webp)
Why Amazon Product Research Matters
Effective Amazon product research is the difference between [scaling profitably](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-scale-your-amazon-business) and burning cash on unsellable inventory. For resellers working in wholesale, [OA](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/is-online-arbitrage-still-profitable-in-2024), or dropshipping, research isn't just helpful – it's the foundation of every smart sourcing decision. Here's why it matters in 2025 more than ever:
### Avoid buying dead inventory
Poor research often leads to products that sit in your [FBA warehouse](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-amazon-fba) for months, racking up [storage fees](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-fba-storage-fees-explained) and tying up capital. Good research helps you validate demand and avoid products with low turnover.
### Spot profit before you commit
Margins are tight on Amazon. Research lets you [estimate margin and ROI](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-profit-margin-for-sellers) upfront, factoring in [selling fees](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-on-amazon), shipping, taxes, and supplier costs – before you ever place an order.
### Beat the competition early
The [Amazon marketplace](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/selling-on-amazon) moves fast. Research helps you catch fast-rising trends, [low-competition gaps](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-find-profitable-products-to-sell-on-amazon), and underpriced products before other sellers flood the listing.
Understand the real sales volume
[BSR (Best Seller Rank)](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-best-sellers-rank-everything-you-need-to-know) is not enough. Research tools give you a clearer picture of real [monthly sales](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-sales-estimator), how fast the product sells, and how often the [Buy Box rotates](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/5-strategies-to-win-the-buy-box-more-often) – data you can't see with a quick listing scan.
### Consider selling eligibility and risks
With proper research, you can filter out [products that you can’t sell](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-restricted-products-complete-guide-for-sellers), or are prone to [IP complaints](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-amazon-ip-complaint-how-to-avoid-ip-complaints). That protects your [account health](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-amazon-seller-account-health-rating) and avoids costly takedowns.
## What Makes a Profitable Amazon Deal?

Amazon Product Research Criteria
Amazon product research is not about browsing or guessing – it’s about verifying that a product meets a defined checklist. Resellers need to evaluate multiple factors before investing: demand, margins, risk level, and the ability to actually sell the item.
In 2025, a [profitable product](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/best-product-ideas-for-amazon-fba) isn’t just one that looks good on paper. It needs to sell consistently, generate strong ROI, and carry [minimal risks](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-products-to-avoid-selling-on-amazon). Below is a complete checklist of the criteria that every product should meet before making it into your sourcing list.
### You must be eligible to sell the product
Before evaluating a product, check whether your account is [allowed to sell it](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-can-i-sell-on-amazon-without-approval). Some products you may not be eligible to sell on your account, especially for new or low-volume sellers. You should verify this early to avoid wasting time and money on [inventory you can’t list](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-list-products-on-amazon-complete-guide).
### The product must meet your profit expectations
Calculate if the product will deliver the profit you need. Factor in your supplier cost, Amazon referral fees, [FBA or FBM fees](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/fba-vs-fbm-which-is-better-for-amazon-sellers), shipping, and any additional charges like prep or VAT. Use Amazon’s [FBA/FBM calculators](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/fbm-and-fba-calculator-by-seller-assistant) to run both fulfillment scenarios.
* Profit
Profit is the dollar amount left after all expenses are deducted from the selling price.
* ROI
Return on Investment (ROI) shows profit as a percentage of total sourcing costs. A healthy range is 15–30% or higher.
![ROI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5f0f65bd35a2f99b9a3bd38e/686530900c924394fdcd2a23_67cae07c9a5b0a8006a694b6_How_to_calculate_ROI_.webp)
ROI
* Margin
Margin shows profit as a percentage of the selling price. Aim for 15% or more.
### The product must sell consistently
Look at BSR (Best Sellers Rank), BSR drops, and sales velocity to evaluate real sales volume. Products with strong demand will turn inventory faster and minimize FBA storage fees. Use tools to confirm consistent movement, not one-time spikes.
### The product must have manageable competition
Evaluate how many sellers are on the listing – especially FBA sellers. If there are 3-15 FBA sellers, competition is usually healthy. If [Amazon is also a seller](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-1p-vs-3p) or dominates the listing, it’s often a red flag. Avoid products where [price wars](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-avoid-a-price-war-on-amazon) are driving the Buy Box price down.
### The Buy Box must rotate fairly
Check how often the [Buy Box rotates](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/buy-box-tracker) and how much Buy Box % each seller gets. If one seller or Amazon controls it most of the time, your [chance of winning is low](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-amazon-buy-box-listing-suppression). Fair Buy Box sharing across multiple sellers means the product is a better resell candidate.
### You must be able to estimate realistic monthly sales
Use data tools to estimate how many units you can expect to sell per month. This helps [calculate how much to order](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-inventory-management) and what revenue you can project. It's key to scaling without overstocking or under-investing.
### The product must not be restricted
Check if the product falls into a restricted category (e.g., [hazmat](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-sell-hazmat-products-on-amazon-the-ultimate-guide), adult, etc.). If it is restricted, you’ll need [Amazon’s approval](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-get-ungated-on-amazon) to list it – which may involve submitting invoices or certificates. Use tools that flag restricted listings in real time.
### The product must not trigger IP complaints
Verify whether the brand has a history of filing intellectual property complaints. Products with active IP alerts should be avoided unless you have authorization to resell. One unresolved complaint can [suspend your listing](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-avoid-amazon-seller-account-suspension) and cost you money.
### The product must be free of hidden risks
* Look for characteristics that could add unexpected costs or complications:
* [Heavy and bulky](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-sell-amazon-large-bulky-extra-large-oversize-products): Increases fulfillment and shipping costs.
* [Fragile](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-fragile-inventory): Requires special packaging, increasing prep fees.
* [Meltable](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-meltable-fba-inventory-all-you-need-to-know): Only eligible for sale during October–April via FBA.
* Hazmat: Requires special approval and handling.
* [Adult products](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-adult-products-guide): Restricted category with strict ad and packaging rules.
* [Generic brands](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/generic-brand-alert-by-seller-assistant-app): Often don’t allow listing offers from outside sellers.
### The pricing must be stable and competitive
Compare the current [Buy Box price](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/keepa-amazon) to the 90-day average. If prices drop too often or too deeply, [margins may be unstable](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-price-your-amazon-products-free-amazon-fba-course-module-9). Look at the Buy Box trend, and whether it’s prone to sharp fluctuations. A predictable price range is better for long-term sales planning.
### You must identify the best-selling variation
If a product has [multiple variations](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-research-amazon-variations-free-amazon-fba-course-module-8) (e.g., size, color, pack count), only a few are likely to sell well. Use the [reviews-to-variation ratio](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/variation-viewer-by-seller-assistant) to estimate which variation gets the most sales. Choose the version that dominates in reviews or ratings.
### You must calculate based on correct unit quantity
If a product is sold in sets or multi-packs, your profit calculation must reflect that. Confirm the number of units per listing (e.g., pack of 2 or 3) and match your sourcing accordingly. Misjudging the [bundle size](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/selling-bundles-on-amazon-free-guide) can skew your ROI and cause inventory mismatches.
## Types of Amazon Product Research
[Amazon product research](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/7-amazon-product-research-tactics) is the process of identifying profitable and low-risk products to sell – before making any buying or listing decisions. Unlike [sourcing, which also involves finding a supplier](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-source-products-to-sell-on-amazon) and placing an order, product research is focused solely on evaluating the deal quality: demand, pricing, margins, competition, and risk.
Product research is typically performed in two ways: [bulk product research](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-do-quick-amazon-product-research) and [single-product research](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-conduct-amazon-product-research-expert-advice). Each method supports different reseller models – and both are essential for building a profitable Amazon catalog.
In 2025, many sellers use specialized tools for each – but one platform stands out: [Seller Assistant](https://www.sellerassistant.app/). This all-in-one product sourcing software offers tools for both bulk research and in-depth single-product checks, making it a powerful tool for all reseller models.
### Bulk product research
Bulk product research, also called [wholesale price list scanning](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/wholesale-product-list), involves analyzing hundreds or thousands of products at once using automated tools. This method is widely used by [wholesale sellers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-wholesale-mastery-proven-strategies-for-2024-success), who review supplier price lists in spreadsheet format to find profitable ASINs at scale.
It’s also adopted by [online arbitrage and dropshipping sellers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/online-arbitrage-vs-dropshipping-which-business-model-is-best-for-you) who parse entire retail or supplier websites, extract product data, and analyze that data in bulk to surface potential deals. Bulk research allows resellers to filter products by ROI, sales rank, [Buy Box trends](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-read-keepa-charts-free-amazon-fba-course-module-7), and eligibility – often before manually reviewing them.
Tools like [Seller Assistant's](https://www.sellerassistant.app/) [Price List Analyzer](https://www.sellerassistant.app/tools/price-list-analyzer) streamlines this process, allowing sellers to upload wholesale lists or extracted product files and get instant product data including profitability and performance breakdown, product risks, and other product research data, and uses advanced filters to identify best deals to resell.
### Single-product research
Single-product research is the process of evaluating individual products one by one. This is the go-to method for [online arbitrage and dropshipping sellers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/online-arbitrage-tools), who conduct [advanced research](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/13-rules-of-oa-product-research-tested-by-pain-and-gain-of-amazon-seller) of single products one by one to identify profitable deals.
Wholesale sellers also use single-product research – typically after automated bulk scans – to verify the metrics of shortlisted products. This deeper check includes analyzing BSR history, Buy Box rotation, IP complaints, restriction status, and [seller competition](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/amazon-competitors-analysis), ensuring the product meets all profitability and risk criteria before purchase.
[Seller Assistant Extension](https://www.sellerassistant.app/) simplifies this workflow. It overlays key product data directly on Amazon listings and shows all necessary product research metrics like profit, ROI, Buy Box %, seller types, alerts, restriction status, etc. – all without switching tabs.
> **Note.** [Seller Assistant](https://www.sellerassistant.app/) is a comprehensive product-sourcing software that helps Amazon sellers quickly find high-profit deals. It combines three extensions: [Seller Assistant Browser Extension](https://www.sellerassistant.app/), and [IP-Alert Chrome Extension by Seller Assistant, and](https://www.sellerassistant.app/products/ip-alert-extension) [VPN by Seller Assistant](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vpn-by-seller-assistant-s/iogkjigmogcifelidoimdideidldfafo)[,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/products/ip-alert-extension) Amazon seller tools: [Price List Analyzer,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/tools/price-list-analyzer) [Brand Analyzer,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/tools/brand-analyzer) [Seller Spy](https://www.sellerassistant.app/tools/seller-spy), [Bulk Restrictions Checker](https://www.sellerassistant.app/tools/bulk-restriction-checker), and [API integrations](https://www.sellerassistant.app/products/api), and features: [Storefront Widget,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/features/storefront-widget) [Side Panel View,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/side-panel-view)  [FBM&FBA Profit Calculator](https://www.sellerassistant.app/fba-calculator), [Quick View](https://www.sellerassistant.app/quickview), [Stock Checker,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/features/stock-checker) [IP Alert](https://www.sellerassistant.app/ip-alert), [Variation Viewer](https://www.sellerassistant.app/features/sales-estimator), [Sales Estimator,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/features/sales-estimator) [Offers,](https://www.sellerassistant.app/features/offers) and [Restrictions Checker](https://www.sellerassistant.app/restrictions-checker).

It offers a robust toolkit of over 20 features built to streamline every part of the sourcing process  – from bulk scanning wholesale supplier sheets for high-margin leads to deep product research and advanced brand and competitor analysis. By using this FBA and FBM product sourcing software, you can easily identify products that have the potential to be sold well on Amazon.
## How to Conduct Bulk Amazon Product Research
Automated bulk product research involves scanning large product lists from suppliers to identify profitable, low-risk items at scale. This method is ideal for [wholesale, online arbitrage, and dropshipping sellers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/online-arbitrage-vs-wholesale-on-amazon-what-is-the-difference) managing high-volume [sourcing operations](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-is-amazon-product-sourcing).
The main goal is to filter supplier catalogs quickly to surface high-ROI, low-risk products – reducing time spent on manual checks and avoiding costly mistakes. Instead of evaluating products one by one, this approach relies on software to automatically match products to Amazon listings and return key performance and profitability data.
### Use Seller Assistant’s Price List Analyzer

## How to Conduct Single-Product Research
Advanced Amazon single-product research is ideal for sellers who prefer a hands-on approach and want total control over product selection. This method focuses on manually [finding profitable items](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/best-items-to-resell) with a visible price gap between a supplier and Amazon.
While slower than bulk research, it allows for deep, precision-based analysis of individual listings – making it perfect for [online arbitrage and dropshipping sellers](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/how-to-choose-products-for-online-arbitrage) hunting quality deals. It's also used by wholesale sellers to verify products shortlisted by automated scans before placing large orders.
### Use Seller Assistant Extension
To start your research, open a product on Amazon. With the Seller Assistant Extension, you get instant access to all core metrics – directly within Amazon, supplier websites, and even [competitor storefronts](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/seller-spy-by-seller-assistant). This allows for [real-time deal evaluation](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/what-are-online-arbitrage-deals-where-to-find-them), covering everything from profitability to risk factors, without switching between tools or tabs.

## FAQ
**What is the difference between product research and product sourcing?**
Product research is about analyzing products to verify if they’re profitable, in-demand, and safe to sell. Product sourcing comes later – it involves finding a supplier and buying the product.
**Do I need both bulk and single-product research?**
Yes – bulk research helps you find potential deals at scale, and single-product research lets you validate each deal before purchasing. Together, they reduce risk and improve ROI.
**Can online arbitrage sellers use bulk research tools?**
Absolutely. OA sellers can extract product data from retail websites and analyze them in bulk using tools like Seller Assistant’s Price List Analyzer.
**Why is Buy Box data important in product research?**
Because around 80% of Amazon sales happen through the Buy Box, knowing who owns it and how it's shared is critical to estimating your chances of getting sales.
**What tools do I need to start Amazon product research?**
You need a bulk analyzer for supplier lists and a browser extension for manual listing checks. Seller Assistant combines both in one platform to simplify the process.
## Final Thoughts
In 2025, [profitable Amazon selling](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/is-selling-on-amazon-worth-it) starts with smart product research. Whether you’re analyzing thousands of ASINs through bulk scans or diving deep into single listings, your success depends on using data to guide every decision.
Bulk product research helps you filter massive supplier lists fast, while single-product research lets you validate deals with precision. The combination of both methods – powered by tools like [Seller Assistant](https://www.sellerassistant.app/) – gives resellers a clear [competitive edge](https://www.sellerassistant.app/blog/7-selling-tips-for-new-amazon-sellers-in-2024) in today’s fast-moving marketplace.

4. Manage inventory smartly

## Basics of Selling on Amazon Explained
Amazon has an enormous reach, with an [approximate 37.6%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/274255/market-share-of-the-leading-retailers-in-us-e-commerce/) US online commerce market share. Sellers who list products on Amazon have access to over 310 million customers globally.
You can tap into this vast pool by listing your products on Amazon, which you can do in two main ways:
* **Sell It Yourself (Merchant Fulfilled):** You source, store, pick, pack, ship, and handle customer service for your products independently. Amazon refers buyers and handles payment processing.
* **Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA):** You send products to Amazon warehouses, and Amazon handles storage, order picking, packing, shipping, and customer service. You manage sourcing and marketing.
Most serious sellers use FBA for scalability and tap into Prime perks. However, depending on the product, [Amazon FBM](https://getida.com/resources/blog/need-to-know/amazon-fbm-shipping-and-selling-your-product/) still plays an important role.

## Why is Amazon Seller Optimization Critical to Success?
Amazon’s marketplace is competitive, with millions of sellers worldwide. Standing out requires constant optimization of your listings and operations.
Consider [these statistics](https://www.junglescout.com/resources/articles/how-much-do-amazon-sellers-make/):
* Only 57% of sellers achieve profit margins above 10%
* Just 28% of sellers maintain margins above 20%
* About 40% of sellers generate between $1,000 and $25,000 in monthly sales
But strategic optimization can dramatically improve these numbers:
* Optimized listings through A/B testing can increase sales by up to [20%](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/manage-your-experiments)
* Basic A+ Content can increase sales [by up to 8%](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/a-content), while well-implemented Premium A+ Content can boost sales by up to 20%
* [Automated pricing](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/automate-pricing) tools help you save money and get more sales at the same time
To join the ranks of successful sellers and maximize your potential, you need to leverage every available advantage – which is where our proven optimization hacks come in.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://getida.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Why-is-Amazon-Seller-Optimization-Critical-to-Success.webp)
## 7 Amazon Seller Hacks that Ensure Quick Results
Here are seven proven Amazon seller hacks for targeting quick wins:
### **1. Automate Price Optimization for Buy Box Wins**
Let’s start with the Buy Box – where [82% of all sales](https://www.datafeedwatch.com/blog/amazon-buy-box) happen. Getting your product featured here can dramatically boost your sales, and it’s all about smart pricing.
Modern repricing tools can automatically adjust your prices to stay competitive while protecting your profits.
Your Buy Box success depends on three main factors:
* Competitive pricing (but not necessarily the lowest)
* Perfect order percentage (keep it above 95%)
* Strong seller metrics (including shipping performance)
**Pro Tip:** *Set your minimum and maximum prices before using any automated tool. This ensures you’ll never sell at a loss, even when competing for the Buy Box.*
### **2. Select Strategic Categories for Best Seller Badge**
While most sellers compete in overcrowded categories, you can take a smarter approach by choosing less competitive ones.
Here’s what you need to do:
Look for categories that make sense for your product but have fewer competitors fighting for the top spot.
For example, if you’re selling a yoga mat, instead of listing it in the massive “Sports & Outdoors” category, you might find better success in “Yoga Equipment” or even more specific subcategories.
However, don’t just pick any random category where you think you can win. Your chosen category must still make sense for your product.
### **3. Integrate Foreign Language Keywords**
Did you know you can tap into international markets without selling internationally?
Many shoppers on Amazon US use search terms in their native languages. Add these keywords to your backend search terms to capture sales you might be missing.
The three most profitable languages to target are:
* Japanese (high conversion rates)
* German (strong buying power)
* Spanish (large US market)
But don’t just run your keywords through Google Translate! That’s a recipe for disaster.
Instead, work with native speakers or professional translators who understand Amazon marketing. They can help you choose search terms that real customers use. You can also do [AI keyword research](https://getida.com/resources/blog/uncategorized/intelligent-keyword-research-with-artificial-intelligence-ai/) to understand search patterns.
Remember to add these keywords only in your backend search terms, not your visible listing content. This keeps your listing clean and professional.

### **4. Manage Inventory Smartly**
Running out of stock or paying excessive storage fees? Both can kill your Amazon business. But here’s the good news: you can avoid both with smart inventory management.
Start by calculating your “perfect order quantity.” This is how much inventory you need to:
* Never run out of stock
* Minimize [Amazon FBA storage fees](https://getida.com/resources/blog/fba-reimbursements/amazon-fba-storage-fees/)
* Maintain healthy cash flow
The magic formula varies for each product, but here’s a simple approach to find yours:
Look at your last 30 days of sales. Multiply your average daily sales by your supplier’s lead time (in days), then add 50% as a safety buffer. This gives you a good starting point for your reorder quantity.
### **5. Optimize Product Bundles**
Creating smart product bundles is a clever way to boost your average order value and differentiate yourself from competitors.
But not just any bundles – we’re talking about carefully crafted combinations that solve specific customer problems.
For example, if you sell yoga mats, don’t just bundle them with random yoga accessories. Instead, create a “Beginner Yogi Kit” or “Hot Yoga Essentials Pack.” This approach increases your average order value and makes your offering unique.
When creating bundles, ask yourself:
* *What products do my customers often buy together?*
* *What combination would solve a specific problem?*
* *Which items have complementary profit margins?*
* *How can I make my bundle unique in the market?*
The best part? Bundling can save you money on [Amazon FBA fees](https://getida.com/resources/blog/fba-reimbursements/the-ultimate-guide-to-amazon-fba-fees-reimbursements/). Since Amazon treats your bundle as one unit instead of multiple items, you often pay less in fulfillment fees.
### **6. Implement Strategic Overnight Repricing**
There is a pricing trick that top sellers use to boost their profits while they sleep.
Here’s the strategy:
Set your repricing tool to increase your prices by 10% between 2 AM and 4 AM.
Why these specific hours? Because very few people are shopping then, but something interesting happens with your competitors’ automated pricing tools.
When you raise your prices, many of your competitors’ automated [Amazon repricers](https://getida.com/resources/blog/need-to-know/important-things-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-repricers/) will follow suit, matching your higher price.
Then, when your prices return to normal at 4 AM – the market price settles at a higher point than before.
So, you’re not just setting your own prices; you’re actually influencing the entire market’s pricing structure for your products!
This strategy works especially well when:
* You have a limited number of competitors
* Other sellers are using automated repricing tools
* Your products are already selling well
Don’t get too aggressive with this strategy, though. Start with small increases and monitor the results. You want to maintain steady sales while maximizing profits, not price yourself out of the market.
**Pro Tip:** *After implementing this strategy, monitor your conversion rates closely. If you notice a significant drop, adjust your overnight price increase percentage.*

### **7. Recover Lost Funds through FBA Reimbursement Audits**
Did you know Amazon sellers lose 1% to 3% of their annual revenue due to FBA discrepancies and errors?
“That doesn’t sound too bad,” you might think. But let’s put it in perspective – if you’re doing $1 million in annual sales, that’s $10,000 to $30,000 of your hard-earned money slipping through the cracks.
The good news is that you don’t have to accept these losses as a “cost of doing business” on Amazon.
Every single one of these discrepancies is potentially recoverable through FBA reimbursement claims. Yes, you can get this money back in your pocket – money you’ve already earned but haven’t received.
Think about all the moving parts in Amazon’s fulfillment process where things can go wrong:
* Inventory discrepancies in warehouses
* Inbound shipment discrepancies
* Incorrect fee charges
* Customer returns that never come
* Mistakenly disposed inventory
**Pro Tip:** [*Amazon’s reimbursement policy*](https://getida.com/resources/blog/fba-reimbursements/amazon-reimbursement-policy/) *gives you up to 120 days maximum to file manual claims for past discrepancies, with most claims due within 60 days. That’s just 2-4 months to claim your eligible refunds, so act promptly!*
But here’s the catch – finding these discrepancies manually is tedious and time-consuming, and you’ll likely miss many claims you’re entitled to. This is where automation becomes crucial.
We are Getida, a specialized FBA auditing service that helps you recover an average of 166% more in FBA reimbursements than sellers handling claims themselves.
Our team of experts (including former Amazonians) continuously audits your account, handles all the data and documentation, and only charges a fee when we successfully recover funds for you.
[Sign up for an audit review](https://new.getida.com/signup?promo=CBL400) and start reinventing these unexpected refunds on your business!

## Key Factors that Impact Amazon FBA Growth
While those hacks target quick wins, optimizing foundational elements sets you up for long-term prosperity selling on Amazon.
Here are five key factors that enable sustainable FBA growth:
* **Comprehensive Financial Management:** Financial visibility is everything, from accurately calculating costs to making data-driven decisions for profitability. Start by [automating your Amazon seller accounting](https://getida.com/resources/blog/amazon-business-tips/automating-your-amazon-seller-accounting/) to manage your numbers efficiently, then use this foundation to make informed scaling decisions.
* **Excellence in Operations and Fulfillment:** Ensuring fast shipping, high inventory accuracy, low defects, and stellar customer service is vital, especially with FBA. These factors directly impact search ranking and conversions.
* **Testing and Optimization:** A/B testing parts of listings and campaigns uncover improvements. Use Amazon’s free A/B testing tools for images, copy, prices, and more to enhance performance.
* **Market and Competitor Analysis:** Continuously analyze market demand, buyer tendencies, seasonality impacts, and competitor actions to stay ahead strategically. Use these insights for effective [Amazon brand management](https://getida.com/resources/blog/need-to-know/how-to-manage-and-promote-your-amazon-brand/) and stay one step ahead of market trends.
* **Amazon FBA Fee Management:** Various Amazon fees can eat into your profits: storage fees, referral fees (ranging from [8% to 15%](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing) depending on category), aged inventory surcharges, refund administration fees, and fulfillment fees. These costs can significantly impact your bottom line without proper management.
Speaking of costs, you may overlook another critical factor—recovering the money you’re already owed. With all the fees and operational costs of selling on Amazon FBA, every dollar counts.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Let’s address some common questions about Amazon seller optimization:
### **What is the Best Way to Optimize for Amazon Buy Box Algorithm?**
The Buy Box algorithm favors sellers with the strongest metrics across shipping times, high feedback ratings, low defect rates, competitive pricing, and Prime eligibility.
Two key optimization hacks include:
* **Use FBA:** Fulfilled by Amazon inventory gets prioritization for winning the [Amazon Buy Box](https://getida.com/resources/blog/amazon-features/winning-the-amazon-buy-box-the-factors-that-matter-the-most/) due to quick shipping.
* **Automatic Repricing:** Repricing software ensures you react to competitors by automatically adjusting prices within set rules to capture more Buy Box time.
### **What Are Some Hacks to Reduce Amazon FBA Fees?**
Top techniques to lower FBA fees include:
* Ship inventory evenly across regions to reduce transfer fees.
* Label products accurately by weight and prep type to prevent incorrect categorization that raises fees.
* Prune aged inventory diligently to avoid [long-term storage fees](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GJ9NNG7RK4TU6E3Z).

### **What Hacks Can Help with Amazon Seller Central Analytics?**
Three powerful analytics hacks to immediately improve your insights:
* Activate the hidden Catalog Listings Report through Seller Support – it reveals all backend fields and competitor data that are not visible in standard reports.
* Use the Search Terms Report and PPC data to identify your highest-converting keywords and optimize listings accordingly.
* Set up automated email reports for key metrics like conversion rates, Buy Box percentage, and inventory health – saving hours of manual tracking time.
## Conclusion
Success on Amazon isn’t about implementing every possible strategy – it’s about making smart choices that maximize your returns.
While these seven hacks can help boost your visibility and sales, they’re just the beginning of your optimization journey. Remember to test what works for your specific business model and adjust accordingly.

Third-party sellers have become the backbone of Amazon's success, accounting for over 60% of all sales on the platform. This statistic represents millions of entrepreneurs, small businesses, and established brands who have turned to Amazon to reach its massive customer base.
At first glance, the opportunity seems boundless—access to hundreds of millions of customers, sophisticated fulfillment infrastructure, and the credibility of selling on one of the world's most trusted platforms. However, beneath this promising surface lies a complex and often treacherous landscape that third-party sellers must navigate daily.
As Amazon has grown, so too have the challenges facing those who rely on the platform for their livelihoods. From sudden account suspensions that can halt business overnight to inventory management nightmares that drain profits, sellers find themselves increasingly vulnerable to forces largely outside their control. The relationship between Amazon and its third-party sellers has evolved into something of a double-edged sword—offering unprecedented opportunity while simultaneously creating significant obstacles to sustainable success.
These challenges have only intensified as Amazon continues to refine its policies, increase its fees, and expand its own product offerings that directly compete with third-party sellers. Many sellers report feeling like they're building businesses on shifting sands, never knowing when a policy change, algorithm update, or new Amazon-branded competitor might undermine years of hard work.
Let's zoom into pressing problems that Amazon third-party sellers face today. Whether you're a seasoned Amazon seller or considering entering the marketplace, understanding these challenges is crucial to developing strategies that can help your business not just survive, but thrive in Amazon's increasingly competitive ecosystem.
‍
## Account Suspension Issues
For Amazon third-party sellers, few phrases strike more fear than "Your selling privileges have been removed." Account suspensions represent an existential threat that can happen without warning, cutting off revenue streams overnight and potentially destroying businesses that took years to build. In 2025, these suspensions have become increasingly common as Amazon tightens its enforcement of policies—sometimes with algorithms making the initial suspension decisions before human review.
The reasons for suspensions are varied and often confusing to sellers. One of the most frustrating causes is the "related account" suspension, where Amazon's algorithms detect a connection between a seller's account and another account that has violated policies. These connections can be as tenuous as using the same IP address, having similar product listings, or even shipping from the same location. One seller described their experience: "After 15 years of selling with perfect metrics, my account was suspended because a former employee apparently started their own Amazon business. Amazon claimed our accounts were 'related' and suspended me without warning."
The appeals process compounds the frustration. Sellers report submitting multiple appeals only to receive generic responses or, worse, no response at all. The lack of direct communication channels means that sellers often feel like they're shouting into the void, with no clear path to resolution. For businesses that derive 80-90% of their revenue from Amazon, these suspensions can be catastrophic, leading to layoffs, inventory liquidation, and even bankruptcy. While Amazon maintains these measures are necessary to protect customers, the collateral damage to legitimate businesses has led many to question whether the platform's approach is too heavy-handed and lacks sufficient due process.
‍
## Inventory Management Challenges
Managing inventory effectively on Amazon has become increasingly complex and costly for third-party sellers. At the heart of this challenge is Amazon's fee structure for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) services, which includes storage fees that can quickly erode profit margins. These fees increase significantly during the holiday season (October through December), precisely when sellers need to stock up for peak sales periods.
The balancing act between avoiding stockouts and preventing excess inventory has become more precarious than ever. Stockouts can devastate a seller's ranking in Amazon's search results, potentially taking months to recover from. Conversely, overstocking leads to long-term storage fees that can turn profitable products into money-losing ventures. One seller shared, "I had to destroy $50,000 worth of perfectly good inventory because the long-term storage fees would have exceeded the product's value. It was either that or pay to have it shipped back, which wasn't economically viable either."
Inventory discrepancies represent another significant headache. Many sellers report that Amazon's inventory counts often don't match their own records, with products mysteriously "disappearing" within Amazon's fulfillment centers. While Amazon has processes to file claims for lost or damaged inventory, the burden of proof falls heavily on sellers, and reimbursement amounts frequently undervalue the lost items. For sellers using third-party inventory management software, these discrepancies create additional complications, as the software may show items as available when they've actually been lost or damaged in Amazon's warehouses.
FBA receiving delays further complicate inventory planning. During peak seasons, Amazon's receiving process can stretch from the standard 3-5 days to several weeks, leaving sellers with inventory in limbo—not available for sale but still incurring costs. These delays force sellers to send inventory earlier than ideal, increasing storage costs and capital tied up in inventory that isn't yet generating revenue.
‍
## Competition from Amazon's Own Products
Perhaps the most controversial challenge facing third-party sellers is competing directly with Amazon itself. The company has developed a vast portfolio of private-label products across numerous categories, from batteries and electronics to clothing and furniture. What makes this competition particularly troubling for sellers is Amazon's access to detailed sales data from third-party products—data that can inform Amazon's decisions about which products to develop under its own brands.
Multiple investigations, including those by The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, have revealed that Amazon has systematically used third-party seller data to identify successful products, create similar items, and then give preferential treatment to its own versions in search results. A 2021 Reuters investigation found documents showing that Amazon's India marketplace had developed strategies to copy competitors' products and manipulate search results to favor Amazon's versions—practices that Amazon has publicly denied engaging in.
The impact on third-party sellers can be devastating. One seller described watching helplessly as their best-selling product was cloned by an Amazon Basics version that immediately received prime placement in search results: "We spent years developing our product and building our brand. Then Amazon created a nearly identical item, priced it 20% lower than we could afford to, and suddenly our sales dropped by 60% overnight."
Amazon's dual role as both marketplace and competitor creates an inherent conflict of interest that many sellers find increasingly difficult to navigate. While Amazon maintains that its private-label products represent a small percentage of total sales, for individual sellers who find themselves competing directly with Amazon's versions, the impact can be business-ending.
‍
## Rising Costs and Fee Increases
The financial squeeze on Amazon third-party sellers has intensified in 2025, with multiple fee increases across various aspects of the selling process. FBA fees, which cover storage and fulfillment of products, have seen consistent annual increases that outpace inflation. These increases are particularly challenging because they often come with minimal notice, giving sellers little time to adjust pricing strategies or explore alternatives.
Referral fees—Amazon's commission on each sale—range from 8% to 45% depending on the category, with most falling between 15% and 20%. When combined with FBA fees, these commissions can consume 30-50% of a product's selling price before accounting for the cost of goods, advertising, returns, and other expenses. One seller noted, "Five years ago, my net margin was around 25%. Today, with the same products and similar sales volume, it's down to 12% due to Amazon's fee increases."
Advertising costs have become another significant expense as organic visibility on Amazon continues to decline. With more sellers competing for the same keywords, the cost-per-click for Amazon's sponsored product ads has increased dramatically. Many sellers report needing to spend 10-15% of their gross revenue on advertising just to maintain their previous sales levels. As one seller put it, "Amazon has effectively turned selling into a pay-to-play model. If you're not spending on ads, you're invisible."
Return processing fees add another layer of cost, particularly in categories with high return rates like clothing and electronics. While Amazon's liberal return policy helps drive customer confidence, sellers bear the financial burden of these returns, including return shipping costs, inspection, repackaging, and in many cases, the inability to resell returned items as new. Some sellers report return rates exceeding 20% in certain categories, with many returns showing signs of use or "wardrobing" (buying with the intent to use briefly and then return).
The cumulative effect of these rising costs has pushed many smaller sellers off the platform entirely, while forcing others to continuously reevaluate their product lines and eliminate items with margins too thin to remain viable under Amazon's fee structure.

Navigating Amazon's constantly evolving policies has become a full-time job for many sellers. The platform regularly updates its terms of service, product requirements, and selling guidelines, often with minimal notice and vague explanations of the changes. These updates can render previously compliant products suddenly non-compliant, requiring immediate action to avoid penalties or listing removals.
Product restrictions and "gated" categories present another significant hurdle. Amazon has increasingly restricted who can sell in certain categories, requiring approval processes that can be opaque and inconsistent. Obtaining permission to sell in restricted categories often requires providing invoices from established wholesalers, proof of authenticity, and sometimes specific certifications or testing documentation. Even sellers who have successfully navigated these requirements report that the rules can change without notice, requiring additional documentation or reapproval.
Documentation requirements have become more stringent across all categories. For example, sellers of electronics now frequently need to provide safety certification documents, while those selling consumable products must provide detailed ingredient lists and expiration date information. While these requirements aim to protect consumers, the implementation often creates confusion and inconsistency, with some sellers receiving approval while others with identical documentation are rejected.
The challenge of keeping up with changing rules is particularly acute for small sellers without dedicated compliance teams. One seller described the situation: "I spend at least 10 hours every week just reading seller forums and Amazon policy updates to make sure I'm not unknowingly violating some new rule. It's exhausting and takes time away from actually growing my business."
‍
## Customer Service and Return Challenges
Amazon's customer-centric approach has set high expectations that third-party sellers must meet, often at significant cost to their businesses. The platform's emphasis on customer satisfaction means that disputes between sellers and buyers are frequently resolved in the customer's favor, even in cases where evidence suggests potential buyer abuse.
Return abuse has become a growing concern for many sellers. Amazon's easy return process, while beneficial for legitimate returns, has created opportunities for some customers to take advantage of the system. Sellers report receiving returns where expensive components have been removed, items have been clearly used extensively, or entirely different products have been returned than what was shipped. Despite these issues, Amazon often issues full refunds to customers before sellers can inspect the returned items.
Negative reviews present another challenge, as they can significantly impact a product's visibility and conversion rate. While legitimate negative feedback is valuable for improvement, sellers report increasing instances of review manipulation by competitors and "review bombing" by customers using reviews to extract concessions rather than reflect their actual experience with the product. Amazon's review removal process heavily favors keeping reviews in place, making it difficult for sellers to contest even clearly fraudulent or misleading reviews.
The A-to-Z Guarantee, which protects customers by ensuring they can receive a refund if a product doesn't arrive or doesn't match the description, creates additional risk for sellers. Claims under this guarantee can be filed up to 90 days after purchase, and Amazon often sides with the customer without requiring substantial evidence of the claim's validity. For sellers, these claims not only result in financial losses but also negatively impact their account health metrics.
Limited direct communication with customers compounds these service challenges. Amazon's messaging system restricts certain types of communication and prohibits sellers from directing customers to external websites or contact methods. This limitation makes it difficult to resolve issues that might require more detailed explanation or troubleshooting than Amazon's messaging system easily allows.

## The Future of Amazon Third-Party Selling
Despite the formidable challenges outlined in this article, Amazon's marketplace continues to attract thousands of new sellers each month. This paradox speaks to the platform's undeniable strengths: unparalleled customer reach, sophisticated logistics infrastructure, and the potential for significant revenue growth. However, the relationship between Amazon and its third-party sellers has reached a critical juncture in 2025, with many sellers questioning whether the benefits still outweigh the mounting obstacles.
The challenges facing Amazon sellers aren't isolated problems but interconnected issues that compound one another. Account suspensions disrupt inventory planning and cash flow. Rising fees force price increases that may reduce competitiveness. Policy changes require constant vigilance and adaptation. And through it all, sellers must contend with the possibility that their success might attract Amazon's attention as a competitor rather than a partner. This complex web of challenges has transformed Amazon selling from what was once seen as a relatively straightforward e-commerce opportunity into a sophisticated business operation requiring expertise across multiple disciplines.
Looking ahead, the future of third-party selling on Amazon will likely be shaped by several countervailing forces. On one hand, regulatory scrutiny of Amazon's dual role as platform and competitor is intensifying globally, potentially leading to restrictions on how Amazon uses seller data or promotes its own products. On the other hand, Amazon's drive for efficiency and profitability suggests that fees will continue to rise and policies will become increasingly algorithmic rather than human-driven. For sellers, success in this environment will require greater diversification across multiple sales channels, sophisticated data analysis to identify profitable niches, and perhaps most importantly, the agility to pivot quickly as conditions change.
The most successful Amazon sellers in 2025 and beyond will be those who approach the platform strategically—leveraging its strengths while actively mitigating its risks. This means viewing Amazon as one component of a broader e-commerce strategy rather than the entirety of one's business. It means building direct customer relationships whenever possible, even within Amazon's restricted communication environment. And it means staying informed and connected with other sellers through communities and forums where collective knowledge can help navigate Amazon's increasingly complex ecosystem.
For all its challenges, Amazon remains an unparalleled opportunity for businesses to reach millions of customers they couldn't access otherwise. The question for sellers isn't whether to sell on Amazon, but how to do so in a way that builds sustainable, resilient businesses capable of weathering the platform's inevitable changes. Those who can master this balancing act will continue to find success, even as the hurdles to that success grow increasingly complex.

## Take Action
If you're currently selling on Amazon or considering entering the marketplace, here are some steps you can take to address the challenges discussed in this article:
Join seller communities like the Amazon Seller Forums, Reddit's r/FulfillmentByAmazon, or Facebook groups dedicated to Amazon sellers to stay informed about policy changes and share experiences.
Explore multi-channel selling on platforms like Walmart, eBay, or your own website to reduce dependence on Amazon.
Consider working with an experienced Amazon consultant or agency that specializes in account management, compliance, and strategy.
Invest in robust inventory management software that integrates with Amazon to help prevent stockouts and overstock situations.
Document everything—keep detailed records of all communications with Amazon, inventory shipments, customer interactions, and policy changes affecting your products.
The path to success on Amazon may be more challenging than ever, but with the right approach, third-party sellers can still build thriving businesses on the world's largest e-commerce platform.

# Are Amazon Third-Party Seller Problems Increasing in 2025?

* [Marketplace Trends & Issues](https://amzdudes.com/tag/marketplace-trends-issues/)
The challenges of [selling on Amazon 3P](https://amzdudes.com/what-is-amazon-3p-complete-breakdown-for-sellers/) are nothing new, but 2025 is shaping up to be one of the toughest years yet for third-party (3P) sellers. From increased competition to stricter policies, many sellers are struggling to keep their businesses running smoothly. If you’re an Amazon seller, you may already be feeling the pressure. But what exactly is happening, and how can you stay ahead?
## **What Are the Major Challenges for Amazon 3P Sellers in 2025?**
The latest scenario in the evolution of the Amazon marketplace simply points to deterioration in the capability of independent sellers to make ends meet. Below are the primary problems many 3P sellers have faced this year:
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1125'%20height='552'%20viewBox='0%200%201125%20552'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://amzdudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/post-1.jpg)
### 1. Increased Competition from Big Brands on Amazon
The Amazon marketplace is still not only promoting its own private-label products but also those of major brand names. This means that smaller 3P sellers must fight harder for visibility and sales. Direct partnerships between major brands and Amazon are further squeezing independent sellers out of top-ranking positions.
The [first-party (1P) business of Amazon](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-1p-vs-3p-2024-review-for-sellers/) has been developing, thus requiring more and more products from a brand directly instead of through the offer of third-party sellers. Instead, this puts even more pressure on independent sellers as Amazon usually undercuts pricing and then pushes 1P listings high up in search results.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1125'%20height='234'%20viewBox='0%200%201125%20234'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://amzdudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Post-2.jpg)
### 2. Stricter Compliance and Policy Enforcement
Amazon has tightened up on compliance rules in the past and consequently has had to suspend more accounts and remove more listings. The main issues would include:
* **Intellectual property complaints** (even if unfounded)
* **Restricted product violations**
* **Fair pricing policy enforcement**
* **Sudden ASIN suppressions due to vague policy violations**
Now, Amazon’s AI-driven enforcement is catching more sellers unawares. Quite frequently, there are automated [suspensions without clear explanations](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-account-under-review-in-2025-what-happens-next/), making it hard to challenge.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1125'%20height='234'%20viewBox='0%200%201125%20234'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://amzdudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Post-3.jpg)
### 3. Rising FBA Fees and Storage Costs
[Fulfillment services by Amazon](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-fba-vs-fbm-7-figure-sellers-cost-benefit-analysis/) are still popular, although costs have skyrocketed. This consists of storage fees for high inventory levels, costs specifically for aged inventory, and higher referral fees all eating into profit margins.
Further on, the [FBA restocking limits](https://amzdudes.com/essential-tips-for-amazon-restock-inventory-in-2024/) keep changing leaving many sellers trying to find the perfect balance of inventory levels. Overstock also results in high storage fees whereas understock results in opportunity loss in sales.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1125'%20height='234'%20viewBox='0%200%201125%20234'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://amzdudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Post-5.jpg)
### 4. Counterfeit and Hijacked Listings
[Unauthorized resellers and counterfeit products](https://amzdudes.com/how-to-report-and-remove-unauthorized-resellers-and-sellers-on-amazon/) remain a major concern. Many legitimate sellers are seeing their listings hijacked, leading to lost revenue and negative customer experiences.
Amazon has introduced programs like Transparency and Project Zero, but hijackers are still finding ways to manipulate listings. Some sellers have reported instances where their authentic listings were suddenly overridden with inaccurate details or even merged with counterfeit versions.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1125'%20height='234'%20viewBox='0%200%201125%20234'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://amzdudes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Post-6.jpg)
### 5. Tougher Advertising Competition
Advertising costs on Amazon are soaring, with PPC (Pay-Per-Click) bids increasing due to more sellers fighting for top placements. Without an [effective advertising strategy](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-advertising-for-7-8-figure-sellers-maximizing-roi-with-customized-campaigns/), it’s becoming difficult to maintain profitability.
A major shift in 2025 is the increased reliance on external traffic. Amazon is favoring sellers who bring in off-Amazon customers via [Google Ads](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChsSEwjuv4uro_aLAxUIl4MHHc5-DfoYACICCAEQABoCZWY&co=1&ase=2&gclid=CjwKCAiArKW-BhAzEiwAZhWsIOTjwYh80VmPhSY94hzk0aRQb8Ws9pHeUVxqrrIUtCmQPyWaFZQRSRoCclQQAvD_BwE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD21Afus-H8Bo8xkcJRk9K_AA1mB2GrsOyouzGTO4uosZBOOnnssJU1CD4dv90Ph8b-w3IKLpD-O6fLZ_pTNKZf3htEY79oZrJsWE4GuHuv6dPvn1b0&sig=AOD64_1OnUND0DVjR_VgHsVL38FNcq69KQ&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjiqYaro_aLAxVV_7sIHaZ6Hi4Q0Qx6BAgREAE), social media, and [influencer collaborations](https://amzdudes.com/why-micro-influencers-are-the-secret-weapon-for-3p-sellers-scaling-quickly/).

### 6. Limited Seller Support and Communication Delays
Amazon’s seller support system has always been a pain point, but in 2025, delays and lack of clear communication have worsened. Many sellers report waiting weeks for [case resolutions](https://amzdudes.com/solving-the-reimbursement-puzzle-recover-lost-profits-from-amazon-fba-errors/), especially for complex issues like account suspensions and ASIN reinstatements.

## **How Amazon Agencies Can Help 3P Sellers Navigate These Challenges**
Given the increasing challenges, many sellers are turning to Amazon agencies like [AMZDudes](https://amzdudes.com/) to stay competitive. Here’s how an experienced agency can make a difference:
* [**Account Management**](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-account-management-services/)**:** Ensure compliance and avoid costly suspensions.
* [**Advertising Optimization**](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-ads-services/)**:** Maximize ROI with data-driven PPC strategies.
* [**Listing Protection**](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-seo-service/)**:** Prevent hijackers and counterfeit issues.
* [**Inventory Planning**](https://amzdudes.com/amazon-wholesale-services/)**:** Reduce storage fees and improve logistics.
* [**Appeals & Suspensions**](https://amzdudes.com/contact-us/)**:** Expedite reinstatements and handle policy disputes.
## **What Should Amazon 3P Sellers Do Next?**
### **1. Review Your Listings and Policies**
Check that all your listings comply with Amazon’s latest policies. Address any potential violations before they become bigger problems.
### **2. Monitor Competitor Strategies**
Watch how Amazon and big brands in your niche are positioning their products. Adjust your pricing, promotions, and content strategies accordingly.
### **3. Invest in Advertising Wisely**
Focus on ad strategies that generate profitable sales, rather than just increasing traffic. Work with an agency to refine your PPC campaigns.
### **4. Strengthen Your Brand**
Utilize Amazon’s Brand Registry, A+ Content, and Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) to make your listings more attractive and protect them from hijackers.
### **5. Partner with an Amazon Agency**
If handling all these challenges alone feels overwhelming, an experienced Amazon agency can help you scale and protect your business.
## **Final Thoughts**

# How to Find Profitable Products to Sell on Amazon in 2025
* [Virendar Singh](https://sellercenter.in/author/virendar/)
* [March 8, 2025](https://sellercenter.in/2025/03/08/)
Finding the right products to sell on Amazon can make or break your e-commerce business. With millions of sellers competing for customer attention, choosing profitable items requires research, strategy, and a bit of market intuition. This guide will walk you through practical steps to discover products that can drive sales and profits in today’s competitive marketplace.
### Why Product Selection Matters
When I started selling on Amazon back in 2020, I picked products based on gut feeling. Big mistake! I ended up with inventory that barely moved. Now I know better – product research is the foundation of Amazon success.
Let’s dive into how you can find products that actually sell and make money.
### Three Essential Steps to Product Discovery
#### 1. Discover What Customers Want
* During festive seasons like Diwali, buying patterns change dramatically. This creates opportunities to sell both everyday products and seasonal items in higher quantities.
**For example**, if you make handicrafts, consider shifting focus to diyas or lanterns during Diwali. These items see huge demand during festivals, which means more sales for you.
#### 2. Research Top-Selling Products
* This is like studying last year’s exam paper to predict what questions might appear this year. Find out which products sell frequently and which ones bring in the most profit.
* Amazon’s Seller Central provides detailed reports on selling activity across the platform. Tools like Amazon Technical Integration can give you even more insights into what’s performing well.
#### 3. Investigate Your Competition
* Thousands of sellers are preparing for upcoming sales events. Study what products your competitors have already introduced. Read their customer reviews to understand any mistakes they’ve made.
* This information helps you develop a better strategy and product line for your business. When you study your competition, you gather both positive and negative feedback that you can use to improve your offerings
#### Using Amazon’s Tools to Find Profitable Products
#### Amazon Best Sellers Lists
* These lists rank the most popular products based on sales. They’re updated hourly, making them reliable for spotting current trends.
* I check these lists weekly and have found several product opportunities by browsing through categories and subcategories. Last month, I discovered a kitchen gadget that was trending upward but still had relatively few sellers.
#### Best Sellers Rank (BSR)
* Look for each product’s Best Sellers Rank in the product information section. Products with higher ranks (lower numbers) sell more frequently.
* A product ranked #500 in Kitchen might sell 50 units daily, while one ranked #20,000 might sell just 1-2 units. Some products have multiple BSRs if they appear in different categories.
#### Movers & Shakers Lists
* Updated hourly, these lists show products with the biggest gains in sales rank over the past 24 hours. They help you identify trending products before they become mainstream.
* When I spotted a pet grooming tool on this list last year, I jumped on the trend early and made excellent profits before the market became saturated.
### Hot New Releases
* If you’re considering launching a new product, check the Hot New Releases section to see how similar products are performing
### Product Opportunity Explorer
This tool provides detailed analytics on trending products across various niches, including:
* **Customer purchasing behavior**
* **Customer reviews and ratings**
* **Product seasonality**
* **Search volume and growth**
* **Average units sold and pricing**
* **Competition levels**
### Top Product Categories in 2025
#### Based on current Amazon Best Sellers lists, these categories offer promising opportunities:
#### Beauty & Personal Care
* Hair growth oils, acne patches, skin moisturizers, and anti-aging products consistently perform well
#### **Home & Kitchen**
* Food scales, insulated tumblers, stainless steel water bottles, and kitchen gadgets remain popular as people spend more time at home
#### Electronics & Accessories
* Surge protectors, smartphone screen protectors, device chargers, and wireless earbuds are among the best-selling electronics
#### Health & Household
* Whey protein powders, vitamins, supplements, and household essentials have seen tremendous growth
#### Pet Supplies
* Products like cat litter, pet hair removers, dog poop bags, and pet beds are consistently in demand
### Practical Strategies for Finding Profitable Products
#### **1. Sell Products That Meet Seasonal Demand**
* One of the most important rules of selling is finding products that solve problems. During festive seasons, consider products that align with cultural celebrations.
* In India, festivals are often associated with extravagance, so creative products can generate significant sales. While selling proven products is safe, exploring new options can increase brand awareness and sales
#### 2. Follow Festive Trends
* Trends change rapidly, especially during festivals. If you notice increasing demand for certain product categories, consider adding them to your inventory.
* I’ve seen sellers double their monthly revenue just by adding Rakhi-themed gift sets a month before the festival.
#### 3. Identify Your Target Audience
* Understand your target audience and the products they’re actively searching for. Programs like Amazon Step and Amazon Launchpad can help you create a product strategy that ensures sales
#### **4. Focus on Higher Profit Margins**
* If you manufacture your products, you can price them accordingly. Otherwise, look for products that match the above criteria while offering higher profit margins.
* Clothing, art, and jewelry typically have good profit margins when sourced from the right suppliers. I’ve found that handmade items often command premium prices while costing relatively little to produce.
#### **5. Put Your Own Spin on Trending Products**
* Ask yourself if you can improve on what’s already selling well. Look for high-demand products with fewer reviews (indicating lower competition).
* Use product reviews to guide potential improvements to existing products. When I launched my kitchen organization line, I addressed common complaints about competing products, which helped my listings stand out.
### Tips for Beginners
#### If you’re just starting out, consider these practical tips:
Choose lightweight products that are easier to package and ship
* Look for products with a long shelf life
* Consider branding potential
* Avoid restricted products
* Start with a price point between ₹2,000-5,000
* Look for products with fewer than 200 reviews but steady sales

## Amazon Marketplace and its global reach
**Amazon Marketplace** is an expansive e-commerce platform that **enables retailers and individual sellers to list their products alongside Amazon’s own offerings, reaching a vast audience of consumers**. As the largest online retailer, Amazon provides an unparalleled opportunity for sellers to tap into a global marketplace that’s actively visited by millions of customers each day.
In 2022 Amazon generated [$513 billion revenue](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/amazon-statistics/), making it the third largest company in the world by revenue. Amazon has **over 300 million active users worldwide**; among these active users, 197 million people visit Amazon.com every month. Amazon ships to more than 100 countries (source: [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/amazon-facts/)). The Amazon marketplace is available, among others, in the US, the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Poland, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, enabling sellers to reach international markets beyond their local domain.
[![Amazon Marketplace Statistics](https://blog.lengow.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Amazon-Marketplace-Statistics.png "Amazon Marketplace Statistics")](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/)
##### Net sales revenue of Amazon from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2023 (in billion U.S. dollars) (source: Statista)
This international aspect of Amazon Marketplace is bolstered by a suite of services designed to **overcome traditional barriers to global commerce**. These include translation services, international shipping and fulfillment programs like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), and customer service management. With these services, Amazon has effectively lowered the entry threshold for sellers aspiring to expand internationally, providing tools and support that help navigate different languages, customs regulations, and logistical challenges.
Moreover, **Amazon’s vast data capabilities offer sellers insights into global market trends, enabling them to make informed decisions about product listings, pricing strategies, and promotional activities**. This data-driven approach aids sellers in tailoring their offerings to meet the specific demands of diverse markets, increasing their chances of success.
By joining Amazon Marketplace, sellers become part of a global e-commerce ecosystem that’s not just vast in its reach but also sophisticated in its operations.
## Benefits of selling on Amazon Marketplace for businesses of all sizes
Selling on Amazon Marketplace presents a **multitude of advantages** for retailers, whether they’re just starting out or are established entities looking to expand their reach. Here are some key benefits:
* **Massive Customer Base**: Amazon has a vast global customer base, which affords sellers instant access to millions of potential customers. This exposure is invaluable for new and growing businesses that might otherwise spend significant resources on marketing to attract attention.
* **Trust Factor**: Amazon is a trusted name in e-commerce. Customers are often more willing to purchase from a new seller on Amazon than from an unknown website due to Amazon’s customer service policies and guarantee of purchase protection.
* **Fulfillment Services**: With Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), businesses can store their products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Amazon will handle packing, shipping, customer service, and returns for these orders, which can significantly ease the logistical burden on sellers and provide customers with the benefit of Amazon Prime’s fast shipping.
* **International Reach**: Amazon operates websites in many countries, making international sales easier for retailers and brands. The platform handles many of the complexities associated with international transactions, including currency conversion and customer support in the local language.
* **Sophisticated Backend Support**: Amazon’s seller tools and analytics help businesses track sales, manage inventory, and gain insights into customer behavior. These tools can be particularly beneficial for small businesses that might not have the resources to develop such sophisticated systems independently.
* **Advertising and Promotion**: Amazon offers a suite of advertising and promotional tools that can help increase product visibility. Options range from sponsored product ads to Amazon’s Deals of the Day, which can attract a high volume of traffic.
* **Scalability**: The marketplace is scalable. Sellers can start small with just a few items and grow their presence on the platform without the need for significant upfront investments in infrastructure or inventory.
* **Customer Feedback Loop**: Seller ratings and feedback on Amazon can help businesses quickly build a reputation. Positive customer reviews can significantly boost sales, and the feedback can also provide valuable insights into product improvements or new product opportunities.
* **Subscription Model**: Amazon offers a subscription model, which can be particularly advantageous for products that are purchased on a regular basis. This model ensures repeat sales and customer retention.
* **Brand Building**: Sellers can register their brand with Amazon, which gives them access to enhanced branding tools like [A+ content and storefronts](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-a-content-pages). This can help businesses create a more compelling online presence and distinguish their products from competitors.
## Step-by-step instructions on setting up an Amazon seller account
Setting up an Amazon seller account is a gateway to accessing a broad customer base on one of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms. Here is a structured guide on how to get started:
**Choose Your Seller Account Type**: Decide between an Individual or Professional account. Individual accounts don’t have a monthly fee, but you pay $0.99 per item sold, while Professional accounts have a monthly fee (the cost can vary based on promotions or country), but no per-item fee.
**Create Your Amazon Seller Account**:
* Visit the Amazon Services or Amazon Seller Central website.
* Click on the ‘Start Selling’ button or ‘Register now’ link.
* Choose the type of account (Individual or Professional) you decided on in step 1.
* Sign in with an existing Amazon account or create a new one.
**Enter Your Business Information**:
* Provide your business name and address.
* Include your contact information for Amazon and customers to use.
* Select a unique display name that will serve as your business identity on Amazon.
**Fill in Your Tax Information**:
* Complete the Amazon Tax Information Interview to comply with tax regulations.
* Provide your Social Security Number or company’s Federal Tax Identification Number, as appropriate.
**Set Up Your Payment Information**:
* Enter the details of a bank account where Amazon can send your sales proceeds.
* Amazon requires a credit card that can be charged for fees if your balance doesn’t cover them.
**Verify Your Identity**:
* Provide a valid phone number where you will receive a call or SMS to confirm your identity.
* Have your passport or national ID card handy for identity verification if required.
* Create Your Amazon Storefront:
* Add your logo, business description, and a return and refund policy.
* Start listing products with clear images and detailed descriptions.
* Ensure your listings are optimized with relevant keywords for better search visibility.
**Understand Shipping and Fulfillment Options**:
* Decide if you’ll fulfill orders yourself (Fulfillment by Merchant – FBM) or use Amazon’s fulfillment services (Fulfillment by Amazon – FBA).
* If using FBA, send your inventory to Amazon’s fulfillment centers following their guidelines.
**Compliance and Quality Assurance**:
* Check Amazon’s seller policies to ensure you comply with all guidelines and quality standards.
* Understand the rules related to product categories, as some require approval to sell.
**Final Checks and Launch**:
* Review all the information provided for accuracy.
* Ensure you understand Amazon’s fee structure.
* When ready, officially launch your Amazon storefront and start selling.
*NB: Launching one product on Amazon is easy, but managing hundreds can be challenging. For large inventories, [**Amazon Flat Files**](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-flat-files/) are essential. They simplify bulk updates and listing management, saving time and improving inventory accuracy.*
Remember to regularly review Amazon’s Seller Central tutorials and guidelines, as they provide valuable information and updates that can help you manage your account and sales effectively. Establishing your seller account is just the beginning; continuous learning and adaptation will be key to your success on Amazon Marketplace.
## Overview of Amazon’s fulfillment options (FBA vs. FBM)
Sellers on the marketplace must choose how to fulfill orders, and the primary options are **Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)** and **Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)**. Each offers distinct advantages and suits different seller needs.
**Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)** is a hands-off approach **where Amazon handles storage, shipping, and customer service**. It’s a comprehensive solution that includes faster shipping for customers through Amazon Prime, potentially increasing sales. However, it involves additional fees for storage and fulfillment, which can impact profit margins, particularly for larger or slower-moving items.
**Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)** means the **seller takes full responsibility for storing, packing, and shipping products**. This option offers more control over the entire process and can be more cost-effective, especially for larger items or those with lower turnover rates. Sellers opting for FBM need to ensure they can meet Amazon’s delivery and customer service standards, which requires robust internal processes.
Choosing between FBA and FBM involves considering factors like product size, turnover rates, cost implications, and operational resources. **Some sellers opt to use both methods, selecting FBA for items that benefit from Prime eligibility and FBM for products where they prefer direct control or have cost advantages**.
## Understanding Amazon’s fee structure for sellers
Amazon’s fee structure for sellers is multifaceted and understanding it is crucial for pricing your products competitively while maintaining profitability. Here’s a short outline of the main fees that Amazon charges its sellers:
* **Referral Fees**: A commission on each sale, varying by category (6% to 45%).
* **Subscription Fees**: Individual plan (no monthly fee, $0.99 per item) or Professional plan (monthly fee, no per-item charge).
* **Fulfillment Fees (FBA)**: Charges for picking, packing, shipping, customer service, and returns, based on product size and weight.
* **Storage Fees (FBA)**: Monthly fees for warehouse storage, based on inventory volume.
* **Closing Fees**: Fixed fees for selling media items like books and DVDs.
* **High-Volume Listing Fees**: For numerous inactive listings.
* **Additional Fees**: For optional services, refunds, or inventory disposal.
In this article you will find everything you need to know about [**Amazon selling fees**](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-selling-fees).
Sellers must **regularly review their account’s fee statements to understand their costs better**. It’s also vital to keep up with any changes in Amazon’s fee structure, **as the company updates its policies and fees periodically**. By thoroughly understanding and anticipating these fees, sellers can set prices that cover costs while remaining attractive to Amazon customers.
## Strategies for effective product listing and optimization
Maximizing visibility and sales on Amazon hinges on effective product listing and optimization. **Employing high-quality images is crucial**; clear, high-resolution pictures from various angles can significantly enhance your product’s presentation. Amazon’s allowance for multiple images should be fully utilized to offer extensive visual information.
In addition, **crafting detailed and accurate product descriptions is vital**. These should highlight key features and benefits, focusing on **unique selling points**, and be formatted with bullet points for easy readability. Integrating relevant keywords is also essential. Research and use keywords that potential customers might use to find products like yours, incorporating them into your title, description, and backend search terms to boost search visibility.
*NB: [**To minimize errors in your Amazon product catalog**](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-errors-1/) and comply with marketplace requirements, ensure all necessary data is accurately completed, paying special attention to the valid values for specific attributes. Remember, improper configuration of your product catalog [can lead to errors in marketplace integration reports](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-errors-2/).*

##### Key Elements to optimize on your Amazon product page (source: Lengow)
**Competitive pricing is another important aspect**; pricing products competitively involves researching similar items’ prices and [possibly using automated repricing tools](https://blog.lengow.com/price-intelligence/automated-pricing-tool-productpine/) to remain competitive. Encouraging customer reviews is also beneficial, as positive feedback can increase your product’s visibility and attractiveness to buyers.
For brand-registered sellers, **utilizing [Amazon’s A+ Content](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-a-content-pages) to enhance descriptions with rich text and images can be particularly effective**. Finally, monitoring product performance through Amazon’s analytics tools and adjusting listings based on trends is key to maintaining effective listings.
Don’t forget to take a look at the top [**Amazon seller tools**](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/amazon-seller-tools/) – there is no getting around some of them.
## Leveraging Amazon advertising and promotional tools
To amplify your product visibility and drive sales on Amazon, it’s essential to tap into the marketplace’s robust suite of [advertising and promotional tools](https://blog.lengow.com/marketplaces/optimise-amazon-ppc-campaigns-3-most-common-issues/).
Begin by setting up **Sponsored Products** to bid on keywords relevant to your items. This places your products in search results or on product detail pages, and you pay per click, making it a cost-effective way to gain visibility. For brand owners, Sponsored Brands can help create more impactful advertisements by featuring your brand logo, a custom headline, and a selection of your products. This not only promotes individual products but also enhances overall brand awareness.
**Sponsored Display ads** are another powerful tool that extends your reach beyond Amazon’s website, targeting customers based on their shopping activities and interests.
Incorporate digital coupons into your strategy, which shoppers can apply directly at checkout for instant discounts. These are particularly effective for attracting deal-seekers and can differentiate your product from competitors.
Participate in **Amazon’s time-limited deals like “Deal of the Day” or “Lightning Deals”** to prompt quick purchases and increase the likelihood of your products being noticed by a larger audience.
Set up **promotions such as discounts or “Buy One Get One” offers**, which can be an excellent way to move inventory quickly, increase cart sizes, and reward loyal customers.
Finally, consider creating an **Amazon Store for your brand**. This gives you a dedicated space to curate your products, highlight key features, and tell your brand’s story, akin to having your own website within Amazon.
**Amazon Prime Video Ads** will launch in 2024, allowing retailers to advertise with shoppable ads on its streaming service for the first time. It could be [a game changer for Amazon sellers](https://blog.lengow.com/amazon-marketplace/prime-video-ads-amazon-sellers/).
Integrating these advertising and promotional tools into your Amazon strategy can lead to enhanced product discoverability, increased sales, and stronger customer loyalty.
## Future trends and how to stay competitive on Amazon
Amazon’s marketplace is constantly evolving, and staying ahead requires an understanding of emerging trends:
**User experience and customer engagement**: Amazon is focusing on unique customer experiences, making shopping seamless and enjoyable. Sellers should prioritize a media strategy that enhances user experience and targets customer needs​​.
**Seasonal and micro-seasonal trends**: Amazon is diversifying its sales events beyond major holidays to include micro-seasonal events like Pet Day or Star Wars Day, creating new opportunities for targeted marketing​​.
**Rise of Amazon advertising**: With product searches on Amazon rising, especially for niche holidays, leveraging Amazon Advertising’s growing platform is essential for reaching the right audience at the right time​​.
**Retail readiness**: Ensuring your products and store are fully optimized for the marketplace is more crucial than ever. This means having accurate listings, sufficient inventory, and a strategy for peak sales events​​.
**Structured advertising campaigns**: Adopt a structured approach to advertising campaigns, focusing on building awareness before, driving sales during, and capturing late buyers after seasonal events​​.

For the past 25 years, Amazon has thrived and earned an ample loyal customer base. Now, it has become one of the largest [eCommerce retailers](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-business-strategy-ideas/). Clearly, there is no slowing down. As popularity rises, more sellers are growing their businesses on Amazon. As 2022 emerged, it’s time to increase your sales on Amazon, starting today. And, here we are to give you tips on how to boost your product sales on Amazon.
So, let’s get started.

## 1. Have a Strong Foundation – Optimize Your Listings For SEO
You need to abide by the [Amazon SEO algorithm](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seo-guide/) and entice your customers with your product listings. Optimize your listings for keyword relevance. Make sure you specify the brand name, product features, material, color, size information aptly. Images play a major role in impressing a buyer. Professional photography entices your audience and motivates the buyers to purchase a product. Highlight the value points of your product using your image. Aim to provide at least 2-3 high-quality images and cover different angles of the product. Leave no room to imagine the product for your customers.
Do not forget [about Google](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/get-sales-private-label-products-google-adwords/). Everything you do on your product listings can be indexed on Google. So, optimize them for Amazon as well as Google. This can make a big difference. It’s easy to understand the effectiveness of your product page optimization and compare it with competitors’ efforts. Using an [on-page SEO tool](https://seranking.com/on-page-checker.html), you can analyze essential metrics that measure optimization quality. This analysis offers insights and suggestions to enhance your page’s visibility and performance on Google
### 2. Multi-Channel Marketing – For New Opportunities and Insights
If you are doing it already, it’s great! If not, start leveraging multiple channels to sell your products.
Promote and sell products anywhere your customers can buy. Find the right customer touchpoints such as a mobile application, a social media platform, or a website matters. Do not restrict yourself to Amazon. The cornerstone of [multi-channel marketing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/multi-channel-retail-guide/) is to invest in the right channel. You can approach these platforms independently.
A few of the popular marketing platforms in 2022 are:
* Amazon
* Your [eCommerce store](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/ecommerce-business-guide/).
* PPC Ads
* eBay
* [Etsy](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-vs-etsy/)
* Social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
* [Affiliate Marketing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/become-best-at-amazon-affiliate-marketing/) or guest posts on various blogs.
Realted Post : [Analysis of Amazon Affiliate Program and Amazon Selling](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-affiliate-program-vs-amazon-selling/)
On the other hand, Amazon is making seller-buyer communication more stringent than ever. So, make sure you establish your own loyal clientele with your e-commerce store, social media accounts, or blogs. Attaching a coupon, flashing a deal, and free shipping during the holiday season or on certain occasions would definitely entice your customers.
Come up with a multi-channel strategy by analyzing consumer choice and purchase patterns. Find out your target audience and harness data to grow your business.

### 3. Get Reviews and Increase Your Sales on Amazon
Customers trust online reviews as personal recommendations. Verified reviews improve trustworthiness. Buyers hardly leave reviews for the products they bought online. Using [review programs like the Amazon vine program](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-vine-program-reviews/) or Early reviewer program would help you boost your sales online.
[Seller feedback](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seller-feedback/) and product reviews increase your product rankings and to a certain extent influence your [BSR](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/become-amazon-best-sellers/). Constructive feedback helps you improve your product performance. So, try to automate your review requests. You can use the [SellerApp review request chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-review-request-too/akaobgcedoikjgdlbecjejhdfhdmobph?hl=en) to automate your reviews on Amazon.
### 4. Maximize Your Advertising Avenues
If you really want to increase sales on Amazon, Sponsored Ads are the way. 2022 is the year of Amazon Advertising. Look beyond keyword optimization and come up with a strong strategy to increase your presence on Amazon. A successful seller strongly balances automatic and manual campaigns by using different PPC strategies. When used properly, Amazon advertising helps you convert at various places in the sales funnel.

![boost amazon product sales](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/boost-amazon-sales.jpg "Top 8 Hacks to Increase Your Product Sales on Amazon and Maximize ROI  3")
### 5. Amazon Customer Metrics –
Customer satisfaction is an essential metric that brings more value to your business. Amazon gives huge importance to customer communication and satisfaction metrics as it wants to create positive experiences for the customers. In the Amazon seller central account, the Account health section will give a brief overview of the customer satisfaction metrics that need your attention.
**Order Defect Rate (ODR)  –**
In the specified duration, the [Amazon order defect rate](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/improve-amazon-order-defect-rate/) (ODR) gives the number of defect orders (by Amazon) by the total number of orders received. Precisely, it’s based on the number of people who have negative experiences with your product.
According to Amazon, a guarantee claim, [chargebacks](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-chargeback/), or negative comments are considered as a defect.
A high ODR can trigger a negative impact on your Amazon account health.
**Pre-fulfillment Cancellation Rate –**
The pre-fulfillment cancellation rate is initiated by the seller before shipment confirmation. This is the number of canceled orders by the total number of orders in a specific period of time. This usually happens if the seller doesn’t have enough stock after a customer places the order. So, Amazon wants you to stock up your inventory to avoid the pre-fulfillment cancellation rate.
You need to aim for a cancellation-rate of **< 2.5%** to meet Amazon’s pre-fulfillment cancellation rate target.
**Policy Violations –**
Policy violations on the seller central account page will notify you about your performance if Amazon policies are violated. This can be due to the way of your item listing or can be the nature of the item itself. The policy violation metric will give the details of unread performance notifications.
* A green tick indicates – No unread performance notifications.
* Yellow Exclamation indicates – You have unread performance notifications.
* Red cross denotes – You need to read the performance notifications as your account health is at risk.
**Late Shipment Rate –**
This metric will give you the percentage of orders that have been dispatched late. An order is considered to be late if it is overdue by 3 or more days. Amazon suggests you set a target of **< 5%**.
**Buyer-Seller Contact Response Time (CRT)**
This is straightforward. The CRT will give you the number of customer messages you have responded to within 24 hours.
```
“Amazon suggests that a seller should respond to the buyer within 24 hours. Failure to do so will negatively impact CRT, thereby Account health.”
```
### 6. Effective Inventory Management – To Increase Your Business Value
This is something we always talk about. Having your inventory stocked up will boost your organic ranking on Amazon. Warehouse and inventory management is increasing in its value and relevance for the past few years. In the US, the number of warehouses has increased by 6.8% in the past 5 years ([U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ENUUS000205493?data_tool=XGtable)). Handling these tasks manually is time-consuming and invokes unwanted errors. So, you need to automate your tasks using appropriate Inventory management software. With an effective inventory management software, you can definitely boost your operations and inventory efficiency.
Of course, third-party inventory management software may not be the best solution for larger sellers who have their own in-house dashboards. Therefore, we recommend they take advantage of SellerApp’s [Amazon Sales Data API](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-seller-api.html) to help them get real-time access and insights into inventory data, trends to plan for future sales, and much more.

### 7. Abide By Amazon’s Rules and Terms of Service
Most of the time, [Account suspension](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/how-to-restore-suspended-seller-account/) is one of the biggest challenges for Amazon sellers. Staying up to date with [Amazon’s terms of service](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-terms-of-service-tos/) and policies is the key to maintain good account health and stay out of suspensions.

### 8. Stay Ahead of the Curve and Win Buy Box
If you want to increase product sales on Amazon, you need to [analyze your competitors’ strategies](https://youtu.be/gNr8zzP2N9I) and capitalize on their weaknesses. With the competition rising on Amazon, it’s hard to stay ahead of the curve. Although Amazon never gives away the exact metrics that influence Buy Box eligibility, however, it considers:
* Seller feedback and product reviews
* An efficient and quick delivery system
* Refunds and return rates
* Inventory volume
* And most importantly, competitive pricing
Besides, for an Amazon seller, sales history comes into the picture to influence the [Buy Box chances](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/how-to-price-right-to-win-the-buy-box/).

Small and medium businesses will gain maximum traction if they leverage [technology](https://www.sellerapp.com/) for business growth. This is critical for Amazon sellers as the e-commerce industry is moving at a fast pace.

# How Brands Can Beat Third-Party 3P Sellers on Amazon and Walmart
[BLOG](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog)
[Digital Shelf](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/category/digital-shelf/)
7 min read
![Third-Party Sellers](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/How-Brands-Can-Beat-3P-Sellers.jpg)
## The Difference Between Third-Party and First-Party Sellers
A first-party (1P) seller is a brand/manufacturer that sells its inventory to Amazon/marketplace, who, then sells it to shoppers on its platform. A third-party (3P) seller, on the other hand, owns the inventory and uses the Amazon marketplace to sell these products to consumers directly. Amazon has a lot of restrictions for 1P selling. In comparison, 3P sellers enjoy autonomy, have more control over what they sell, and can implement dynamic pricing, making it highly popular with sellers and, more recently, with some brands as well.
## Understanding the 3P Marketplace
The rise in marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, and Target has led to a steady increase in third party (3P) sellers. The 3P marketplace is an online channel that enables independent sellers to sell their products to consumers directly. These sellers leverage the reach and trust these established marketplaces build to sell their products. Today, the 3P seller network is in millions and is a significant threat to brands and manufacturers competing to sell to the same audiences.
3P sellers either buy products directly from brands/manufacturers, resellers, or might sell stolen/ counterfeit goods. While they enjoy the profits from selling your brand’s goods, they do not contribute to maintaining your brand integrity or brand image. With millions of 3P sellers selling on global marketplaces like Amazon, it has become imperative for brands to employ strategies to successfully compete against them and maintain and grow their [share of search](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/mastering-share-of-search-digital-shelf/), visibility, and pricing power on marketplaces. This blog post will explore how brands can successfully navigate the 3P seller ecosystem and outperform 3P sellers through data-driven strategies.
## 4 Ways to Win Against 3P Sellers on Marketplaces
Amazon most likely prefers established 3P sellers over new 1P sellers. Nevertheless, there are ways that 1P seller brands could compete to outperform 3P sellers on the marketplace.
### 1. Win the Buy Box
A sure-shot way to increase visibility and conversions on Amazon is by winning the buy box. Winning the buy box builds trust with shoppers and gives you the ‘buy box bias’ advantage. Irrespective of whether you are a first-party or a third-party seller, win the buy box with the below strategies:
a. Pricing below your competitors
Sellers with the most [competitive pricing](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/competitive-pricing-strategy-see-products-priced/) have the highest chance of winning the buy box. To get the price advantage, brands must monitor and optimize prices to win advantage over 3P sellers.
b. Ensuring your products are always in stock
You will surely lose the buy box advantage if your product runs out of stock. A solid supply chain and constant visibility into your inventory levels are vital to make it to the buy box and maintain a strong Amazon presence.
c. Maintaining a favorable seller profile
Amazon gives preferences to sellers with solid metrics and positive reviews and ratings. Lower performance metrics, negative reviews, and an unfavorable seller profile can affect the chances of winning the buy box.
d. By having robust fulfillment methods
Amazon expects sellers to meet shipping dates and offer fast, hassle-free delivery. This is an effective way to increase your chances of appearing on the buy box.
### 2. Control Your Supply Chain
Closely controlling your supply chain can make it difficult for third party sellers to source your products. The first step is to identify the 3P sellers selling your products. Then, find where they source products and close that loop. These steps will significantly reduce the number of sellers selling your products. A few other ways to control the supply are:
a. Closely monitoring and eliminating counterfeit sellers
Third party sellers often sell counterfeit goods or lower quality variations of branded products.  Tracking down counterfeiters and [MAP violators](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/minimum-advertised-price-win-win-retailers-manufacturers/) and taking swift action against them can reduce many 3P sellers. Along with brand dilution, these sellers also eat into your margins and profits by selling low quality product variations. Brands can employ [automated MAP monitoring solutions](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/amazon-map-monitoring/) to identify violators and maintain close control over their seller network.
b. Limiting the promotions you run
Many 3P sellers stock up on branded goods by buying in bulk when brands run promotional offers. Once the promotions end, these sellers sell the same products at a lower price for many months to come, undercutting the brand. Hence, brands need to limit the order size per consumer whenever they run promotional offers. This action can effectively hinder 3P sellers from stocking their products for a fraction of the price.
### 3. Manage Product Variants
Managing and unifying product variants under a single listing can help restrict the third party seller network on Amazon. And in turn improve search visibility and conversions. Brands need to identify and report ASINs of duplicate pages and get them merged into a single listing. Listings with all product variations like sizes, colors, flavors, and no. of units listed under a single listing get more search queries and are proritized by Amazon.
Brands can also request Amazon to merge all 3P ASINs of their products under their own listings, This can help control what listings are shown to consumers when they search for a particular product.
### 4. Adopt a 3P/Hybrid Selling Model
1P selling has its drawbacks and limitations on marketplaces like Amazon. On the other hand, 3P sellers have much more control and ownership over their listings. Such as using dynamic pricing, better managing their inventory, and building relationships with consumers directly. Hence, many brands today choose to sell their products as 3P sellers or by partnering with 3P enablement partners. Often, they choose a hybrid model, combining the benefits of both 1P and 3P models for better results. With this hybrid model, brands can control their online inventory better. For example, if the 1P listing goes out of stock, it can be quickly replaced with the inventory listed via the 3P listing, thus maintaining optimal inventory at all times.
**Leveraging Data and Analytics for a Successful 3P Strategy**
Data is a powerful tool for refining and optimizing a 3P strategy. Brands can monitor 3P sellers, track their performance compared to competitors, monitor key metrics, and optimize marketing and [pricing strategies](https://www.intelligencenode.com/blog/its-all-about-the-pricing-strategies/) by leveraging AI-driven, intelligent analytics.
* **Track Performance Metrics:** Regularly monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales velocity, Buy Box percentage, and conversion rates.
* **Analyze Customer Feedback:** Analyze customer reviews and feedback to identify areas for improvement and innovation.
* **Monitor Market Trends:** Stay informed about broader market trends, including shifts in consumer behavior and competitive dynamics.
* **Optimize Prices:** Use intuitive dynamic pricing strategies to reprice products to gain a competitive advantage while protecting your margins.
* **Manage Assortment and Inventory:** Leverage data to offer the right assortments to shoppers and ensure your products never go out of stock.
## Conclusion: Dominating the 3P Marketplace
Online marketplaces are the go-to destinations for a majority of shoppers. A recent survey found that [50% of US shoppers start their product searches on Amazon](https://www.intelligentreach.com/news/ecommerce-news/product-discovery-journeys-start-at-amazon-not-google/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20shoppers%20start%20their,no%20reviews%20available%20for%20it.), making it one of the most powerful online channels to sell your products. While 3P sellers dominate marketplaces like Amazon, brands can regain control of their products and sales by adopting the right tools and strategies.

# Tips and tricks we have been following for selling on Amazon.
[![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/31/amazonservices/AmazonSaathiProgram/Logo-v2._SL1280_FMpng_.png)](/seller-blog/amazon-saathi)
Hi Fellow Sellers,
I really hope you all are doing well. This post is regarding my experience of selling on Amazon. We have been associated with Amazon since April 2014 and are now able to provide livelihood to nearly 50 artisans only through our online selling journey. Every year we experience a growth on Amazon and therefore thought of sharing my experience with you all -
Some of the things which we follow regularly are:
## 1) Bring in the new selection
When Customers come on Amazon and reach your brand store, it becomes important for you to showcase new products and fresh launches every time they visit your Amazon brand store. Don’t limit yourself only to bestsellers, rather add and showcase your new selection regularly and create bestsellers out of them as well.
## 2) Improving the quality of your product details page
This is the most important factor which will help you generate good sales. When a Customer visits Amazon product details page, based upon the information displayed, he/she makes the buying decision. It is therefore quite important to improve the product details page so as to increase the conversion rate and also to lower the post sales returns. Some practices to follow:
a) Improving Image Quality – Use High Quality Images covering almost all the product angles. Use Lifestyle Images (in secondary images) if possible. This give customers a better picture before buying the product.
b) Improving Product Title - Write the product title wisely so as to include all the important product details. Customers read the product title from the search results itself before they click on your listing.
c) Clearly write the Product Features in Bullet Points - Bullet Points should be both incredibly detailed and also should include a lot of keywords which will help your product show in Customer’s search results.
d) A sellable Product description - Do not stuff your listings with just words rather sell the benefits of your products. Every time we write a description, we put ourselves in customer’s shoes and understand whether based on this product description, we would buy this product or not.
e) Leverage the benefits of Enhanced Brand Content - Convert Listings to A+ Listings. The EBC gives more wide view of the product to the Customer. More images and elaborated product descriptions give you the space to tell your product’s story in a more engaging way. As a brand owner, telling your brand’s story and connecting with your buyers builds brand awareness and loyalty. It differentiates you from the competition and can encourage repeat purchases.
## 3) Understanding Amazon’s Search Results or the “A9” Algorithm
Since Amazon is an open marketplace with millions of products, your listings needs to appear at top in order for it to reach the Customers. Amazon’s search pulls relevant results from their catalogue and then they rank them according to relevancy. Therefore, it is important to align your listings as per the Amazon’s search algorithm in order for them to appear in Customer’s search results and good keywords can help in this.
• A keyword is a specific phrase or sentence that customers type into the search engine to look up products on Amazon’s portal. A product listing rich in keywords has a higher chance of appearing in search results for multiple queries, increasing traffic and sales opportunity.
• The major and general keywords will have a lot of competition yet generate the most traffic. Try to add more specific keywords. They might generate lesser traffic but typically have higher click-through rates, as the traffic is more focused.
• Your “Product Title” and “Bullet Points” are your potential keywords. Apart from adding keywords in Product Title, bullet points etc., please try to add maximum of them (from a Customer’s point of view) at backend in the “Search Terms” tab.
## 4) Consider FBA
When you ship your products to Amazon FC, you do not have to worry anymore about the pick and pack process. This way you can focus entirely on your core business rather than being occupied only in operational tasks. [Amazon’s Prime tag](https://sell.amazon.in/grow-your-business/tools) helps in increasing the Customer’s trust for your brand along with an increase in product visibility which means higher Sales.
With FBA, we get the benefit of cost effective shipping charges and at the same time our products instantly become eligible for all the PIN Codes across country. One Day and Two Day delivery program also ensures repeat sales with many Customers.
Sending our goods to FBA also means that we do not have to worry about the hassle of returns as [Amazon FBA](https://sell.amazon.in/sell-online/fulfillment-by-amazon.html) also handles all the return process for us. They manage customer inquiries, return shipping labels and reverse logistics. Also, the FBA listings are clicked & purchased more by Customers, which increases its Amazon Page Rank thus making it better than other listings & appearing more frequently in the search results.
Apart from potentially unlimited storage space to store your goods for any of the sale events, FBA staff is also well trained in packing and dispatching the goods neatly. We have received many positive feedback and positive Customer reviews stating that the products were packed neatly and delivered well before the time.
## 5) Advertising
As Amazon is an open marketplace with millions of products and many products being added daily, using [Amazon’s sponsored Ads](https://sell.amazon.in/grow-your-business/advertise) will lead to higher visibility of your products in the Amazon search results and the best part is that you will be charged only when a shopper clicks on your ad and not for the impressions.
Sponsored Products can help bring awareness to even to the newly launched products by getting them in front of more potential customers. You can either create automatic targeting campaigns where based upon your listing data, Amazon will place your ASINs in the relevant search results or you can go for a manual product targeting wherein you enter certain keywords and your listings will appear when Customer searches for those Keywords. However, a mix and match of both the types is preferred.
We always advertise our products and brand on Amazon. Consider this as a way to increase your product’s page rank which can bring your product in search results even when not being advertised. Sales history is a strong ranking factor for search results. If a product sells better, then next time Amazon will place it higher up in the ranking of search results.

![Insider Tips for sourcing winning products on Amazon](https://b3382211.smushcdn.com/3382211/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Insider-Tips-1200x628-1.jpg?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1)
*This is a guest post from [Zignify](https://zignify.net/?utm_source=myfbaprep).*
With [millions of active sellers](https://www.edesk.com/blog/amazon-statistics-2020/#:~:text=Amazon%20has%209.7%20million%20sellers,for%20%2480.5%20billion%20in%20sales.) on Amazon, standing out can be tough. It takes smart [product sourcing for Amazon](https://wonnda.com/magazine/product-sourcing-strategies/), solid planning, and nonstop tweaking to thrive on the marketplace. Sourcing winning products on Amazon can make the difference between a successful business and one that struggles to gain traction.
To gain that competitive advantage, it’s crucial to understand the strategies and best practices for finding products that not only sell but also generate substantial profits. In this article, we’ll dive into insider tips and strategies that can help you find lucrative items that fly off the virtual shelves. Read on to learn how to discover the most profitable products for a lucrative venture on Amazon.
## Product sourcing for Amazon: Market research and product niche selection
Before product sourcing for Amazon, your product niche selection is critically important, especially for businesses that use [Amazon FBA](https://zignify.net/mastering-amazon-fba-a-comprehensive-guide-to-success/). It’s the foundation upon which your entire eCommerce venture rests. To identify a profitable niche for Amazon FBA, follow these steps:
* **Interest:** Look for a niche that aligns with your interests and passions. When you’re deeply invested in the products you sell, it fuels your determination and dedication. Your enthusiasm will also resonate with potential customers, fostering stronger engagement and boosting sales.
* **Demand:** Conduct comprehensive market research to gauge the demand for products within your chosen niche. Leverage tools like Jungle Scout, Helium 10, or AMZScout to analyze search volumes, sales trends, and the overall competitive landscape. Target niches with consistent and growing demand to ensure sustained profitability.
* **Competition:** You want a niche with low to moderate competition to increase your chances of success, as it allows you to stand out without established brands overshadowing you. Look for gaps in the market where consumer needs aren’t being met.
* **Profitability:** While it’s tempting to go after products with the highest demand, remember to analyze profitability first. Calculate your potential profit by factoring in product costs, Amazon fees, shipping, and other expenses. Aim for items with healthy margins.
* **Product size and weight:** Consider the logistical aspects of shipping and storage. [Smaller, lightweight products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArRHpxmRRmg&t=8s) are often easier and cheaper to handle, especially if you utilize Amazon’s FBA services.
## Product sourcing on Amazon: Identify and analyze competitors
Understanding your competition is essential to source winning products. Study bestsellers in your chosen niche to determine what makes them successful, looking at factors such as **pricing, customer reviews, and product listings and features**.
When product sourcing for Amazon, identify gaps in the market that you can fill with a unique offering. If your competitors’ reviews frequently mention poor packaging for instance, ensure yours is superior. This can become a unique selling point (USP) for your listing.
Examine your potential competitors as well. If the market is oversaturated with established sellers, it might be wise to choose a different niche or look for unique product variations that can give you a competitive edge. You can adopt tools like [Keepa](https://keepa.com/?utm_source=myfbaprep) or [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/) to track competitor pricing and sales trends over time.
## Product sourcing on Amazon: Focus on product differentiation
To stand out on Amazon, your product needs to offer something unique. This could be **an innovative feature, superior quality, or a special design**.
When product sourcing on Amazon consider adding value through bundling complementary items or offering exceptional customer service. You can also achieve product differentiation through branding and packaging: A well-designed package can enhance perceived value and attract more buyers.
## Find reliable suppliers
Once you’ve decided on a niche, it’s time to [find reputable suppliers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjuz9UTM1Y), which are crucial for maintaining product quality and ensuring timely deliveries. They’ll also help you maintain consistent stock levels and avoid negative customer reviews due to quality issues. Before committing to a particular provider though, request samples to assess product quality.
You can seek out reliable suppliers in places like:
* **Alibaba and other B2B platforms:** A platform like [Alibaba](https://zignify.net/a-comprehensive-guide-to-successful-product-sourcing-on-alibaba-for-amazon-sellers-and-e-commerce-sellers/) is a great place to find suppliers, especially if you source products from overseas. Look for suppliers with a history of positive reviews and high response rates.
* **Trade shows:** Attending trade shows and industry-specific events opens the opportunity to establish direct relationships with suppliers. It also allows you to assess the quality of the products firsthand.
* **Local sourcing:** Look into product sourcing for Amazon locally or within your country. Local suppliers often provide faster shipping times and easier communication, which can be a competitive advantage.
* **Third-party services:** Consider enlisting a reputable product sourcing company like [Zignify Global Product Sourcing](https://zignify.net/). They specialize in connecting you with reliable manufacturers worldwide, ensuring you find the right partners to meet your business needs. Zignify offers comprehensive solutions for all your product sourcing needs.
Your suppliers and manufacturers play a crucial role in the success of your Amazon business. Cultivate open communication, negotiate favorable terms, and establish trust and reliability to ensure seamless supply chain management and product quality control.
## Invest in product quality
Product quality is paramount to maintain a good reputation on Amazon, as inferior offerings lead to negative reviews, returns, and, ultimately, lost sales. So, amid the excitement of sourcing and launching products on Amazon, you need to develop robust [quality control](https://zignify.net/mastering-product-quality-a-guide-for-amazon-sellers-when-sourcing-products-from-china/) measures to support customer satisfaction and your brand reputation. Here’s how:
* [**Supplier verification**](https://zignify.net/conducting-a-supplier-evaluation-consider-these-5-questions/)**:** Conduct thorough background checks and site visits to verify the credibility and manufacturing standards of your suppliers. Request product samples for inspection and testing before placing bulk orders.
* **Product testing:** Invest in third-party testing services or in-house quality assurance processes to assess product durability, functionality, and compliance with safety standards. Test items under real-world conditions to identify any potential defects or performance issues.
* **Certifications and compliance:** Ensure your products meet relevant industry certifications, regulatory requirements, and Amazon’s guidelines for product safety and authenticity. Display certifications prominently in product listings to instill confidence in buyers.
* **Batch inspections:** Implement regular batch inspections during the production process to detect and rectify quality deviations. Inspect raw materials, components, and finished goods for consistency, accuracy, and adherence to specifications.
* **Feedback loop:** Establish a feedback loop with suppliers, manufacturers, and customers to gather insights, address quality concerns, and drive continuous improvement. You can then use customer reviews and return data to identify quality issues and take corrective actions proactively.
## Explore private labeling opportunities
Private labeling allows you to **create a brand and sell unique products under your label**. Work with manufacturers to customize existing products or develop new ones tailored to your target market. Invest in branding, packaging, and marketing to build name recognition and customer loyalty over time.
## Wrapping up product sourcing for Amazon — Discover your next bestseller
Your eCommerce store offerings must be unique to help you stand out on the Amazon marketplace and realize lucrative returns. Given that importance, you need to develop a strategy for product sourcing for Amazon to find the best items for your business.
By implementing a healthy mix of technology, research, and optimization, as well as employing the other strategies outlined in this article, you can position your Amazon store for success and unlock the full potential of the world’s largest online marketplace.

# Ways to boost your sales on Amazon
Amazon India is the [largest e-commerce marketplace](https://sell.amazon.in/?tag=blogboostsales) which is being visited by millions of shoppers every single day.
As a seller on Amazon, it is very important that the product being sold should be visible to relevant shoppers and from time to time sellers should take the initiative to market the products for greater visibility.
In this post, I am sharing various ways to boost your sales on Amazon India Marketplace.
Remember this -> Your product needs visibility to the “target audience” or “Niche audience” hence you should learn how to market products to your niche buyers and also the repeat buyers
Try the following ways to give a boost to your product sales.
If one gets an invitation from [Amazon for the Seller Flex program](https://sell.amazon.in/?tag=blogboostsales), has their own space, a team to responsibly handle the everyday inbounding/packing/managing returns, then one shouldn't hesitate in moving to Seller Flex.
## 1. Lightning Deals
A Lightning Deal is a time-bound, promotional offer where an item is featured for a limited number of hours, usually 6 to 8 hours (as determined by Amazon), on the [Amazon Deals page](https://www.amazon.in/gp/goldbox/?initialSessionID=259-7746998-2107207&ld=SDINBlogDirect&pageName=IN%3ASD%3ABlog-PageNB44%3ASaathi-ways-t-boost-sales).
Deals are visible under the deals section with the time duration mentioned and help in increasing sales.
![Lightning Deals Amazon](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/31/amazonservices/Blog/Image_1_Amazon._SL1280_FMpng_.png "Lightning Deals Amazon")
## The seller needs to be eligible to run lightning deals
All Prime sellers are eligible to run Lightning Deals and the following criteria also must be met:
• Products must have a sales history on Amazon and at least a 3-star rating if there are 5 or more customer ratings.
• Variations - Deals should include as many product variations (e.g. size, colour, style etc.) as possible. For some products, such as clothing and shoes, at least 50% of variations should be included in the deal. (The predetermined minimum percentage of product variations are specified when you create the deal)
• Not a restricted product or offensive, embarrassing or inappropriate product
• New Condition
• Compliant with customer product reviews policies at Amazon
• Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) or Seller Fulfilled Prime
Try to create one deal today.
## 2. Coupons
We all shop online and what’s better if we go online and open a product page we like and coupon flashes right in front to be grabbed for a discount at checkout.
![Amazon Coupons](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/31/amazonservices/Blog/Image_2_Amazon._SL1280_FMpng_.png "Amazon Coupons")
We will simply grab the limited time offer hence coupons are attractive and profitable to offer.
Coupons are discounts on a single product or a set of products and discoverable to shoppers through various means like:-
• [Coupons home page](https://www.amazon.in/l/10465704031?initialSessionID=259-7746998-2107207&ld=SDINBlogDirect&pageName=IN%3ASD%3ABlog-PageNB44%3ASaathi-ways-t-boost-sales)• Search results
• Product detail pages
• The Offer Listings page
• In their carts
## Do coupons have some criteria?
The following products are not eligible for coupons:
• Products in used condition, collectables, or certified refurbished
• Adult products
• The following product types are not allowed:
~ Sexual Wellness
~ Hunting and Fishing
~ Guns and gun accessories
~ Restricted products
• Cannot have content on the product detail page that may be offensive, embarrassing, or inappropriate.
It is also important to note here that coupons cannot be provided as an incentive for customer reviews (either explicitly or implicitly), and customer reviews that result from purchases with coupons may not always get the "Amazon Verified Purchase".
## Coupon targeting
Coupons work on a defined budget by sellers and the best part of that you can target or set conditions like
• Target only to Prime customers
• Coupons providing a fixed % off
• Coupons with a fixed amount off
If you a have a social media fan page or an email list of prospects, go ahead and share the coupon with your customers to grab the deal.
## 3. Sponsered Ads
Your product needs to be shown to the targeted customer and Sponsered ads backed by a long tail and highly focused or niche keywords is the way to go
Amazon offers cost-per-click advertising. You can see how much you’re spending for clicks on your ads, target keywords shoppers are using, and measure the impact of your campaigns. You can adjust your budget and bids at any time to test what’s working well, and to test new keywords.
I personally recommend a review every 15 days till you get your golden 10 keywords visited by shoppers.
Another feature worth mentioning here is Amazon offers ads in two formats.
1. Sponsored Products that promote the individual products you sell on Amazon. You choose which products to advertise, assign keywords or product attributes to target, and enter a cost-per-click amount.
2. Sponsored Brands which increases awareness of your products. The ad creative you build includes a headline, logo, and product images. When shoppers click your Sponsored Brand, you can specify whether they will go to the Amazon Store for your brand, or any page that displays your products on Amazon. You can showcase all products you offer by bringing the customer to your brand page and sell unlimited.
So, if you as an Amazon seller has never tried any of the promotional methods above, you may be losing some selling opportunities.
Only to manufacture, or keep in Inventory is not good but to market, sell and replenish Inventory is the need of the business.
Wish you success and luck. Start your Amazon journer [here](https://sell.amazon.in/?tag=blogboostsales).

Selling on Amazon can be valuable to many business owners, whether you’re a small business launching its [first product line](/blog/how-to-start-a-product-line) or an established company seeking global expansion.
As the world’s largest online marketplace—with [300 million](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/amazon-statistics/) customers making at least one purchase annually—Amazon has extraordinary [brand recognition](/blog/brand-recognition), and its onboarding process for businesses is relatively easy. Still, you might have some questions before creating your Seller central account, which gives you access to a suite of tools and resources to manage your business.
This guide offers tips and strategies for building a successful business on Amazon.
## How to sell on Amazon for beginners
1. [Conduct market research](#11)
2. [Choose a selling strategy](#22)
3. [Write a business plan](#33)
4. [Create an Amazon seller account](#44)
5. [Decide which fulfillment option to use](#55)
6. [List your first product](#66)
### 1. Conduct market research
Use [market research](/blog/what-is-market-research) and [competitive analysis](/blog/competitive-analysis) to help you decide what to sell on Amazon. You’re looking for [products that are trending](/blog/trending-products) and have a good [profit margin](/blog/profit-margin) in a space with relatively weak competition. There are a few ways you can assess the current market landscape on Amazon and decide which products to prioritize:
#### Review Amazon bestsellers lists
Amazon’s bestsellers page is a great place to find product ideas based on what’s selling well right now on the site. Although it takes time for a product to attain [Amazon bestsellers rank](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-best-sellers-rank) (it’s based on sales volume), you can still get a sense of what consumers are buying. Can you offer a version of a popular product that [serves a specific niche](/blog/niche-markets) or satisfies an unmet need?
![Amazon's best sellers rankings show the most popular products in every category.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed_7735d70b-050f-4e47-9fc1-b437bb1f8ed8.png?v=1708017454)
#### Use keyword research tools
[Jungle Scout](https://www.junglescout.com/) is a popular keyword research tool that can narrow down your list of ideal products to sell. When you use a keyword research tool like this, you make decisions based on data. The search volume of a product helps you determine consumer interest.
![The Jungle Scout keyword scout dashboard shows search volume for a variety of related keywords.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-1_479192b1-c814-4489-abd7-c506da8d70c3.png?v=1708017525)

#### Read Amazon reviews
When customers review products, they may unwittingly reveal gaps in the market. Take a look at Amazon product reviews to determine what customers like and dislike about specific brands and products. You may be able to find a consistent problem with competitors’ products that your product can solve.
#### Check for restrictions
After deciding which products you are going to sell, check Amazon’s [list of product restrictions](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330) to make sure you are in compliance. Items like fine art, surveillance equipment, and recycled electronics are among the products not allowed. Certain products must go through a [preapproval process](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200333160) before you can sell them. Read the [overview of product categories](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200332540?language=en-US&ref=efph_G200332540_cont_200333160) before setting up your account.
Unify your sales channels with Shopify
Only Shopify unifies your sales channels and gives you all the tools you need to manage your business, market to customers, and sell everywhere in one place.

### 2. Choose a selling strategy
Depending on the product you’re selling and the amount of capital at your disposal, you’ll likely choose one or more of the following ways to sell on Amazon:
* **Retail arbitrage.** If you buy something below market value and sell it at a higher price while profiting off the difference, that’s retail arbitrage. Amazon sellers can search for products on sale or clearance at places like Target, Best Buy, and Big Lots, then sell them on Amazon for a higher price.
* **White labeling.** Generic products with your own brand name or logo added are known as [white label products](/blog/white-label). You don’t need to have any manufacturing or [product design](/blog/product-design) experience to sell white label products—your focus is primarily on sourcing quality products and creating appealing branding.
* **Private labeling.** [Private-label products](/blog/private-label) are produced by a third-party manufacturer based on retailers’ specifications. Retailers then market and sell those products under their own brand. You can find private label products through marketplaces like [Alibaba](/blog/16665772-alibaba-101-how-to-safely-source-products-from-the-worlds-biggest-supplier-directory) and [Thomasnet](https://www.thomasnet.com/).
* **Dropshipping.** When [dropshipping on Amazon](/blog/amazon-dropshipping), you never keep products in inventory. When someone purchases a product, the order goes to a third party. The third party then fulfills and ships the product to the customer.
### 3. Write a business plan
Draft a [strategic business plan](/blog/strategic-business-plan) that details elements that are crucial to business success. Action items can [include the following](/blog/business-plan):
* [Listing your products to sell](/blog/business-plan)
* Determining [product pricing](/blog/how-to-price-your-product)
* Defining your [marketing plan](/blog/marketing-plan)
* Identifying your [ecommerce business model](/blog/types-of-ecommerce)
* Creating a plan for [inventory management](/retail/inventory-management)
### 4. Create an Amazon seller account
To create an Amazon seller account, you must first decide what type of seller plan you need: individual or professional. The main difference between the two depends on your projected volume of sales.
![Comparison of Amazon individual and Amazon professional seller accounts.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed_205f6a24-36da-47ea-b47a-1c61b3b8ddea.jpg?v=1708017690)
Amazon sellers have two plan options: individual or professional.
The individual plan is a pay-as-you-go plan that gives you access to basic listing and order management tools. Individual sellers pay a [$0.99 seller’s fee](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing) every time they sell an item. If you sell fewer than 40 products per month, the individual plan may be for you. Once you sell more than 40 items per month, the individual plan becomes more expensive than the professional plan, so you may as well upgrade.
The professional seller plan is a $39.99 monthly subscription service that offers a [suite of tools and benefits](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees), including [global selling programs](https://sell.amazon.com/global-selling), advanced business reports, and eligibility for Amazon’s [Featured Offer position](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/buy-box-featured-offer).
Once you’ve selected a plan, it’s time to set up your new Amazon seller account. Collect the following information and enter it on the [Seller Central signup page](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/):
* [Business email address](/blog/business-email-ideas)
* Bank account number and bank routing number
* Active credit card
* Government issued national ID
* [Tax information](/blog/tax-id-number)
* Phone number
![Amazon seller central signup form.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-1_fe5a18ca-c9c1-4b6f-b1c6-5b6fe59657c8.jpg?v=1708017781)
Once your Amazon seller account is approved, you’re ready to get your products listed and start selling.

### 5. Decide which fulfillment option to use
As a seller, you have two [fulfillment](/blog/fulfillment-services) options: fulfillment by merchant and fulfillment by Amazon:
#### Fulfillment by merchant (FBM)
With FBM, you [fulfill orders directly to customers](/shipping) and manage shipping[,](/shipping) returns, and customer service. This is a good option for made-to-order products or for products that require a longer lead time for processing.
#### Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
With [FBA](/blog/direct-fulfillment#3), you send inventory to an Amazon warehouse, known as an Amazon Fulfillment Center (FC). These fulfillment centers ship products and manage returns from customers. You control inventory levels and pay storage fees for the product, in addition to a fulfillment fee for every unit sold to customers. Keep in mind, you still own the inventory until a customer receives it.
In this model, Amazon handles payment from the customer and, in turn, pays you. You get access to Amazon’s customer service team that handles questions, returns, and refunds.
### 6. List your first product
There are two ways you can list a product on Amazon: The first is for products already for sale on Amazon—these products have an existing [Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)](https://marketplaceconnecthelp.shopify.com/hc/en-us/articles/7243955227663-What-is-an-ASIN), and your listing will be combined with the product detail page for all other sellers offering this product. The second is for new products (private label products) that you’re listing on Amazon for the first time.
Let’s consider the initial example: Say you’re selling travel mugs you bought at wholesale prices, and there’s already a listing on Amazon for that exact product.
1. The first thing you’ll need to do is copy the ASIN from the "product details" section of the existing listing.
2. Next, navigate to Seller Central, click Catalog and select Add Products. This brings up a search bar where you can paste the ASIN. Doing so will bring up the product listing. Use the dropdown to describe the condition of your item (New, Used - Like New, Used - Very Good, etc.)
3. Click “Sell this product,” set your price, select your fulfillment options (FBM or FBA), and follow the subsequent prompts. You have the option to enter a [SKU](/blog/what-is-a-stock-keeping-unit) for your item, after which you can click the “Save and finish” button. You can view your listing in the “Manage inventory” page of your Seller Central account.
Now let’s look at the process for listing a product that has never been sold on Amazon, like your own line of emu leather platform clogs. Here’s how it works:
1. From the Seller Central dashboard, you’ll again click “Add a product” followed by “I’'m adding a product not sold on Amazon.”
2. Choose your product category from the list, then enter all relevant information about your product (title, price, details, photos, fulfillment options).
3. Once you’re done with this, simply click “Save and finish” and your product will be submitted for approval. Once it’s approved, Amazon will assign it an ASIN and list it for sale. You can access the listing via your “Manage inventory” page.
Once your product detail page is live, shoppers can discover your product by searching on Amazon. If your product has appeal and you use effective marketing strategies, soon enough the orders will start rolling in.
## How to create successful product listings on Amazon
1. [Write a targeted product title](#111)
2. [Upload clear product images](#222)
3. [Write thorough product descriptions](#333)
4. [Include product variants](#444)
The product detail page of your product listing is where the sales happen on Amazon. The information you put on this page helps customers decide whether or not your product meets their needs. Candle brand [Homesick](https://homesick.com/) has a stellar example of a [product page](/blog/product-page). Let’s look at why.
![Amazon product page for Homesick Candle Hawaii.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-2.jpg?v=1708017932)
### 1. Write a targeted product title
Your product title should capture shoppers’ attention and tell them they are in the right place. A good product title with [targeted keywords](/blog/14207073-the-beginners-guide-to-keyword-research-for-ecommerce) can improve your click-through rate in search and boost your [SEO ranking within Amazon’s platform](/blog/keys-to-early-success-on-amazon).
Amazon product titles have a 200-character limit, but [Amazon Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/seller-forums/discussions/t/6a063172-4a5f-42a8-a53d-3ada769efd6a) recommends keeping titles under 80 characters. Concise product titles are easier to read on mobile devices, where longer titles are typically truncated due to the smaller screen size. Since [more than 50%](https://amzscout.net/blog/amazon-statistics/) of Amazon traffic comes from mobile devices, it's wise to optimize wherever you can.
Every word in your product title is searchable, so aim to include vital information. For example, Homesick uses its brand name (Homesick)*,* the product line (Scented Candle), the style (Hawaii), features (Scents of Pineapple, Coconut), and the container size.
![Amazon product page for Homesick brand candle in Hawaii scent.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-3.jpg?v=1708018127)
### 2. Upload clear product images
Your main photo should clearly show what the product is. Additional photos can provide other angles of the product and, if relevant, lifestyle imagery.
![Additional photo of Homesick Scented Candles with burn times, display, etc.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-2_49ee946c-980f-4966-b333-d3bf42c16f11.png?v=1708018302)
You can also add video to give shoppers a more in-depth look at your products. Shoppers can scroll through your media to assess if the product is a good fit for their needs. Take care that your images are high quality so that shoppers can zoom in to see the finer details of your product.
### 3. Write thorough product descriptions
Product descriptions list the specifications and benefits of your product. Homesick uses bullet points for its descriptions, highlighting key information potential buyers look for in a candle, such as burn time, scent notes, and type of wax.

### 4. Include product variants
Variations of your products let you easily display the same product in various sizes, colors, and styles. While each version of a product has its own unique ASIN and detail page, [product variants](/blog/product-variant) give customers the ability to quickly switch between options.
## Cost of selling on Amazon
When you start selling on Amazon, there are some fees you should be aware of because they’re frequently charged and can impact your Amazon channel’s [return on investment](/blog/what-is-return-on-investment) (ROI). The following fees aren’t the only fees, just the common ones:
* **Referral fees.** Amazon charges a commission for selling on the platform. It’s different for each category. The [average referral fee](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees) is 15% but can range from 8% to 45%.
* **Closing fees.** This is a [$1.80 fee](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees) taken from each unit sold for products in media categories (books, DVDs, music, software and computer/video games, video game consoles, and video game accessories).
* **FBA fees.** If you use [Fulfillment by Amazon](https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon) you’ll pay a fee that covers picking, packing, shipping, and customer service. The exact cost depends on your product’s category, size, and weight, but it starts out at just a few dollars.
* **Additional Amazon fees.** Amazon will also charge you storage fees for inventory in its fulfillment centers, with additional fees for aged inventory that has been in storage for more than 181 days. You may also have to pay fees for unsold inventory that Amazon returns to you, discards, or liquidates.
For an in-depth look at all possible fees, read the [selling on Amazon fees guide](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/help-page.html?itemID=6F7CN3EQS7MEGCN&language=en_US&ref=efph_6F7CN3EQS7MEGCN_bred_G67WTAUHB9TQ9M6U).

Amazon gives ecommerce businesses a unique opportunity to sell products to a wider audience, helping improve brand awareness in the process. Here are key tips for getting there:
### Encourage product reviews
Reviews can be the deciding factor in a purchase, even if the product has a higher price than competitors’ offerings. One way to encourage [reviews from customers](/blog/15359677-why-online-store-owners-should-embrace-online-reviews) is to send a follow-up email after a customer purchases your product.
Amazon sellers can send customers automated follow-up emails that are related to a specific order. The [guidelines are here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFXJvlZvNwg) but, in summary, you may not:
* Send emails with marketing or promotional messages.
* Include links to websites other than Amazon.
* Request or incentivize positive reviews.
You can, however, send emails that ask the customer to leave a review—so long as you don’t specifically request that the feedback be positive.
There are ample best practices for [email marketing](/blog/email-marketing) out there, but aim to send no more than two emails: one during the order confirmation or delivery phase and one [post-purchase email](/blog/post-sales-emails-turn-buyers-into-fans) after the customer receives the product.
### Run sponsored product ads
Amazon has a robust ad platform that lets you market your products to Amazon customers. Amazon Sponsored Product Ads is a [PPC (pay per click)](/blog/ecommerce-ppc-management) model that lets you promote your Amazon products. Ad placements on desktop can be above, alongside, or below search results for related search terms, as well as on product detail pages.
![Sponsored product Amazon ads for Homesick Scented Candles within a search for candles.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-5.jpg?v=1708018522)
A few things to keep in mind when running Amazon PPC ads:
* **Start with automatic targeting.** This allows Amazon to use its powerful search algorithms to automatically discover and suggest an exhaustive list of potential keywords for you. You can begin by selecting a flat default bid across all keywords, but your eventual goal is to get data on how various keywords perform and target the ones that are most effective.
* **Evaluate your automatic targeting campaign.** Assess your automatic targeting campaign once you have at least a few weeks’ worth of data to determine which keywords performed the best. You want to transition those over to a manual campaign, where you can focus on only the most relevant keywords. With a manual campaign, you have the ability to adjust bids by keyword.
* **Continue to iterate your manual campaign for keywords and bids.** Different bid amounts can yield various placements and results, so continue to test until you find a strategy that works well for you.
* **Use insights to optimize product details pages.** As you refine your PPC strategy, you’ll gain a better sense of which keywords are relevant to your product. You can add those keywords to your product detail pages to help you capture more organic traffic without having to pay for ads.
### Take advantage of promotions
Leveraging promotions can help you generate sales and increase [brand awareness](/blog/brand-awareness). A popular type of promotion on the Amazon platform is [Lightning Deals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3L8JX7Q9FH8ALB). These deals are flash sales featured on the [Amazon Deals](https://www.amazon.com/deals), one of the most frequently visited pages on Amazon.
Lightning Deals can help:
* Increase discoverability of your product, especially during big events such as Prime Day and holidays.
* Lead to more online reviews due to greater product reach and sales.
* Drive conversions after the promotion ends, as more units sold can improve rankings on [search engine results pages](/blog/serp).
* Trial new products and win new customers for future purchases.
Lightning Deals appear in the “See All Recommendations” section of the screen on Seller Central. Lightning Deals run across many different categories, including health and personal care, home and kitchen, consumer electronics, fashion, grocery, and much more.
![Amazon Today's Deals include Lightning Deals of limited time discounts on popular products.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-6.jpg?v=1708018621)
### Drive external traffic
Many brands reserve their external marketing channels to point to their [ecommerce store](/blog/start-online-store). While there is value in using ads to direct traffic to your own site, those same tactics also work to promote your Amazon listings.
If you collaborate with bloggers and [influencers](/blog/influencer-marketing), you can expand your reach through programs like [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) and [Amazon Influencers](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/influencers)—as well as external platforms for connecting with influencers, such as [Shopify Collabs](/blog/influencer-marketing-platforms-to-find-creators#0).

Build and manage a community of influencers who love your brand
Shopify Collabs can help you recruit and manage creators who can promote your products, endorse your brand, and ultimately increase your sales.

---
Additionally, you can create discount codes to share externally, such as on your [social media channels](/blog/social-media-small-businesses), to encourage customers to buy on Amazon.
### Get your pricing right
Finding the right [pricing strategy](/blog/pricing-strategies) for your products is especially important in Amazon’s marketplace, where you compete against other sellers. Here are some key considerations when aiming to hit the right pricing:
#### Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
According to the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy: You can’t set a price that "[harms customer trust](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V).” Amazon offers some examples of pricing practices that raise red flags, including pricing a product significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon, selling bundles of multiple units for a higher price per unit than if sold individually, and adding excessive shipping fees. Avoid a potential account suspension by pricing your products fairly.
#### Automate pricing
Repricing tools like Amazon’s [Automate Pricing](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/automate-pricing) on Seller Central help you to automatically make pricing decisions. With the free Automate Pricing tool, you can establish parameters for pricing products and specify how to automatically [adjust product prices to a competitive level](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G201994820).
![Amazon Today's Deals page featuring various products running deals.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed-7.jpg?v=1708018702)
## Complement your Shopify store by selling on Amazon
At first glance, Amazon can seem like a challenger to your ecommerce business: a global marketplace, a massive audience, a go-to destination for consumer search. However, when approached as a resource, Amazon can actually help entrepreneurs make money online. Under the right circumstances, [selling on Amazon is worth it](/blog/6399562-the-pros-and-cons-of-selling-on-amazon-and-ebay) for Shopify store owners.
Your Shopify store is your home base, and Amazon’s global marketplace is your opportunity to reach massive new audiences. Strategic planning, experimentation, and some hustle will get you a long way to successfully selling on Amazon.

![Amazon seller hacks that will boost your revenue](https://d2bw95mh2ee04s.cloudfront.net/prod/content/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/15144322/amazon-seller-hacks.jpeg)
Competition on Amazon has always been absurdly high and with every year we advance, the number of competitors is definitely not diminishing – quite the contrary, actually. The good news is, there are plenty of Amazon seller hacks that you can apply in your everyday worklife that will make your job not only easier, but also set you apart from the competition. SELLERLOGIC has been working together with bestsellers of the industry for many years and during this time, we were able to pick up one or the other selling method that will give you an unfair advantage on the platform. Let’s dive right into our 15 hacks for Amazon.
## #1 Monopolize Your Niche
While it makes sense to keep an eye on trends and to expand your portfolio wherever possible, there is real money to be made in specific niches. Especially if you are able to box out the competition there.
Focusing on a specific niche allows you to tailor products and marketing efforts to a targeted audience, reducing competition and increasing visibility. This specialization can build strong customer loyalty and establish you as an expert in your field.
The benefits are definitely worth investing time into. They include reduced competition, targeted marketing, higher conversion rates, and the potential for higher profit margins. Customers are often willing to pay more for products that specifically meet their needs.
Here are a few tips:
* Identify your niche by researching market demand, analyze competitors, and engage with potential customers to understand their needs.
* Choose a niche with manageable competition and sufficient profit margins, leveraging your expertise for an added advantage.
* Define your target audience with buyer personas, create a specialized product line, and optimize listings with niche-specific keywords. Develop targeted content to attract and engage customers, and build a community through forums and social media.
* By continuously monitoring trends and feedback, you can adapt and maintain relevance and grow sustainably.
## #2 Pay to Win – Use Amazon PPC Campaigns to Target Long-Tail Keywords
Boost your Amazon sales with PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaigns by targeting long-tail keywords, which are more specific and less competitive than short, broad terms. Start with a thorough keyword research using tools like Amazon’s own keyword planner. Then go ahead and use these long-tail keywords for your ad campaigns to reach a more targeted audience that is closer to making a purchase decision. By bidding on less competitive long-tail keywords, you can achieve a higher conversion rate and lower Cost-Per-Click (CPC), ultimately improving your return on investment (ROI) and boosting your product visibility.
## #3 Sell on Multiple Channels
Whether it’s the question of [Ebay vs. Amazon](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/selling-on-amazon-vs-ebay/) or if maybe your selfmade handsoaps would have better chances flying off the shelves on a platform like Etsy. Multichannel selling will always be one of the hacks for Amazon that will generate you some solid extra revenue when correctly done. Here is why:
Selling on multiple channels gives you more ways to make money and reduces the dangers of relying only on Amazon. It helps you reach more people and different types of customers. Pick platforms that fit your product. For example, handmade items do well on Etsy, while electronics can sell well on eBay. Using different channels also makes your brand more known and trusted. Overall, selling on multiple platforms increases your sales chances, keeps your business steady, and helps you grow by reaching more buyers.
## #4 Know Your Numbers
Imagine trying to grow your business without knowing your numbers, an impossible endeavor.
Knowing your costs and profit margins is key to making smart business decisions on Amazon. Start by figuring out all your costs, including production, shipping, Amazon fees, marketing, storage, and any other expenses.
Once you know your total costs, calculate your gross profit margin by subtracting these costs from your sales revenue and then dividing by your sales revenue. This shows how much profit you make on each sale before other expenses.
For a complete picture, calculate your net profit margin by subtracting all operating expenses from your gross profit and then dividing by your sales revenue. This tells you your overall profit after all costs.
Understanding these margins helps you set the right prices, run effective promotions, and find ways to save money. It also lets you see if new products will be profitable and keeps track of your business’s financial health.
**In short, knowing your costs and profit margins helps you stay competitive and successful on Amazon. It ensures you make informed decisions that keep your business profitable.**
If monitoring your numbers comfortably and ensuring your profitability constantly are a requirement for you to run your business, [SELLERLOGIC Business Analytics](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/business-analytics-tool-amazon/) was developed for you.

## #5 Optimize for the Buy Box, but at the Best Price
Every experienced seller knows that [winning the Buy Box on Amazon](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-win-the-amazon-buy-box-in-13-steps/) is crucial. However, not everyone understands how to maintain the Buy Box while selling at the highest possible price. Here’s what you need to do:
1. Identify the competitor currently holding the Buy Box and offer a lower price to win it for yourself.
2. Once you secure the Buy Box, gradually increase your price in small increments. Monitor your sales as you do this. You aim to keep the Buy Box visibility while selling at the highest price. If you notice a decline in sales, it signals that you may have lost the Buy Box. At this point, lower your price to regain it.
As you might have guessed, this method drains a lot of your resources and time. This is why [SELLERLOGIC developed the Repricer](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/amazon-dynamic-repricing-tool), which will win you the Buy Box for your B2B and B2C products automatically, so that you can focus on more important things than your pricing.
![Amazon hacks for 2023 and 2024](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA0wAAAGxAQAAAAB5dQv0AAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAABESURBVHja7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tDQ+gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQwO0+wABcB6ylgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)![Amazon hacks for 2023 and 2024](https://d2bw95mh2ee04s.cloudfront.net/prod/content/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/15104700/amazon-hacks-.jpeg)
## #6 Optimize Storage Space to Reduce Fees and Improve Efficiency
Another Amazon selling hack that will save you money is managing storage space effectively. Monitor inventory levels with Amazon’s Inventory Performance Dashboard to avoid overstocking. Use FBA for fast-selling items and third-party services for slower sellers to keep storage fees low.
Moreover, implement a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) system to move older stock first, reducing aged inventory fees. Regularly review and remove slow-moving or unsellable products to free up space for more profitable items. This approach helps minimize fees and maximize inventory turnover, making your Amazon business more efficient and cost-effective.
## #7 Develop a Unique Brand Identity
Building a strong brand identity is key to standing out from your competitors. Good branding helps you earn trust and credibility, making customers more likely to pick your products. Your brand should reflect your values and personality, making it memorable and recognizable. This boosts customer loyalty and repeat sales.
Keep your branding consistent across everything—product listings, packaging, and customer service—to create a great customer experience. Also, having your own online store, not just an Amazon page, adds a professional touch. It shows customers you’re serious and helps close sales by making your brand look more legit.
In a fiercely competitive marketplace like Amazon, a good brand identity and your own website are essential for standing out and achieving long-term success.
## #8 Leverage Product Reviews for Social Proof
One of the most effective ways to build trust with potential buyers is through positive product reviews. [Customer reviews](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/amazon-seller-review) serve as social proof, demonstrating that your product is not only legitimate but also of high quality. Amazon customers rely heavily on reviews before making purchase decisions, and having a solid number of positive reviews can significantly improve your conversion rate.
If you sell over FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant), encourage satisfied customers to leave reviews by following up post-purchase with a polite request. You can also use Amazon’s “Request a Review” button to automate this process. In addition, always respond to negative reviews professionally, offering solutions or clarifications. This not only shows that you care about customer feedback but also reassures potential buyers who may be hesitant due to negative comments.
Building a collection of genuine, positive reviews helps increase product visibility, boosts credibility, and ultimately leads to more sales.

## #9 Use Amazon FBA to Scale
In full honesty, this actually does not belong in the section of Amazon selling hacks, but is rather a requirement nowadays for sellers.
[Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/amazon-seller-fba/) is a powerful tool for scaling your business. With FBA, Amazon handles the logistics for you, from storage and packaging to shipping and customer service. This allows you to focus on other areas of your business, such as sourcing new products or improving your marketing strategies.
FBA also makes your products eligible for Amazon Prime, giving you access to a large base of loyal Prime members who are more likely to buy products with free and fast shipping options. Moreover, FBA increases the chances of winning the Buy Box, as Amazon favors sellers using their fulfillment services.
While FBA comes with fees, the trade-off in terms of scalability and customer satisfaction is often worth it. Take the time to assess whether FBA is suitable for your product line and if the benefits outweigh the costs.
## #10 Optimize Your Product Listings
A well-optimized product listing is essential for success on Amazon. From product titles to bullet points and descriptions, each element should be crafted to catch the eye of both customers and Amazon’s search algorithm.
Start by conducting keyword research to ensure you’re using relevant search terms in your title, description, and backend keywords. Make sure your product images are high-quality and showcase your product from various angles, as visual appeal plays a huge role in the buying process.
Your listing should clearly highlight the product’s benefits, using bullet points and [A+ content](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/amazon-a-plus-content-enhanced-brand-content-on-amazon/) to make key features stand out. Avoid long, cluttered sentences; instead, focus on readability and clarity. By optimizing your listings, you can improve your product’s search ranking, attract more traffic, and ultimately convert more browsers into buyers.
## #11 Automate Repricing to Stay Competitive
We already mentioned how intelligent pricing and especially solutions like the [SELLERLOGIC Repricer](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/amazon-dynamic-repricing-tool) can win you the Buy Box, but there is a little more to it than that.
Pricing can make or break your success on Amazon, and manually adjusting your prices to stay competitive can be time-consuming. This is where solutions like the Repricer become essential. With SELLERLOGIC, your prices are automatically based on changes in competitor pricing, market demand, and other factors. This applies to wholesale and private label products alike.
By setting rules for your minimum and maximum price, you ensure your product stays competitively priced while maintaining profitability. Automated repricing not only helps you stay in the Buy Box, but also increases sales velocity, and reduces the time spent on manual price adjustments.

## #12 Offer Bundles and Promotions
Another effective way to boost your sales on Amazon is by offering product bundles and promotions. By combining complementary products into a bundle, you can increase the perceived value and sell at a higher price point. Bundles also provide customers with convenience and incentivize them to purchase more items at once, which can lead to higher order values.
In addition, take advantage of Amazon’s promotions and deals, such as Lightning Deals or coupons, to drive traffic and boost sales during low demand periods. These promotions can also help clear out slow-moving inventory or introduce new products to your customer base.
Be strategic with your promotions and bundles, ensuring they align with your overall business goals and contribute to your profit margins.

## #13 Use Amazon Brand Analytics
[Amazon Brand Analytics](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/brand-analytics) is a powerful tool that provides insights into customer behavior, competitor performance, and keyword trends. By using this data, you can make informed decisions about your marketing strategies, product listings, advertising campaigns and ultimately discover how to sell more on Amazon.
The tool offers valuable metrics such as search term rankings, demographic insights, and competitive benchmarking, helping you understand what drives customer purchases. This information can be used to optimize your product listings, improve ad targeting, and identify new growth opportunities.
For registered brands, Amazon Brand Analytics is an indispensable resource that helps you stay competitive and refine your approach to maximize sales.
## #14 Invest in Customer Service
If you are not using FBA for your customer service, you can make use of the options open to you in regard to improving the customer journey you provide for the buyers. Excellent customer service is crucial to building long-term relationships with your customers. On Amazon, this can manifest in various ways, from responding quickly to customer inquiries to resolving issues with refunds or exchanges.
By going above and beyond with customer service, you can turn one-time buyers into repeat customers and encourage [them to leave positive reviews](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-get-more-amazon-reviews/). Implement systems to respond to customer questions promptly and offer clear solutions to problems.
Even on a large platform like Amazon, exceptional service can differentiate your brand and foster customer loyalty.
## #15 Get Reimbursed for FBA Errors
Using Amazon FBA has so many benefits for sellers, it would actually be considered unwise to not let Amazon handle your fulfillment for you these days. However, when it comes to getting reimbursed for errors that happen with your products during the FBA process, you have to invest time and effort if you don’t want to lose substantial funds to the online giant.
Here’s the problem: not only is it quite complicated to get reimbursed for Amazon’s mistakes with your products, but sometimes the reimbursement amount is so little that it’s not even worth the time investment on your part.
The smartest way to solve these problems is by automating this very tedious process. [SELLERLOGIC Lost & Found Full Service](https://www.sellerlogic.com/en/amazon-lost-and-found) can identify all these reimbursement claims for you and recover your funds without you having to lift a finger. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you are looking to get your money back quickly and efficiently.

Have you ever pondered on why some products always seem to show up in Amazon searches, while others barely get any attention? Or how do some Amazon product listings keep getting clicks and have a high rate of sales while others don’t?
The mysterious workings of Amazon’s complex ranking system can sometimes leave sellers scratching their heads about what will result in increased exposure on its site – but there are some definite tendencies from which one might extrapolate trends as to why certain items do better than others.
It seems that many factors contribute to a successful product listing on Amazon, but one of the most important is product listing optimization. In this article, we will explore [crucial aspects of Amazon SEO](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seo-guide/) and what guidelines to follow to optimize your Amazon product listings for driving sales and improving conversion rates.
### **What is Amazon product listing and why is its optimization important?**
An Amazon product listing or product page tells customers all they need to know about a given product. It features images, and videos of the products, product descriptions, and offers customer reviews from those who have already purchased them.
Amazon product listing optimization is the process of optimizing your listings to increase traffic and conversion. It is one of the most crucial tactics to keep your product on top. For you to be successful, you must succeed in this area and make sure all areas are accounted for from product title, description, reviews (which should have a significant number), [advertising strategy](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/advanced-amazon-ppc-strategy-revealed/), and visibility through keywords and other means.
[![amazon success steps](https://cdn.sellerapp.com/Blog_images/amazon-success-steps.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 2")](https://www.sellerapp.com/schedule-demo.html?referrer=blog-mid)
Amazon product listing optimization is key to creating a personalized and memorable experience for online shoppers. Not to mention, more than [353 million items](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/) are sold on Amazon, which can create near-endless competition in the Amazon Marketplace. Therefore, even if you have a top-notch item to sell, you won’t be able to generate sales if customers can’t find your product among a sea of competitors. Optimizing these listings ensures that shoppers will be able to easily locate or search for those products!
Optimizing your Amazon product listing also ensures consistency across branding, messaging, reviews, and ratings – while simultaneously increasing visibility on Amazon’s search engine results page.

## **Introduction to Amazon’s A9 Algorithm**
A9 is the name of a search engine algorithm that Amazon developed to power its product searches. It’s been around for about two years and has grown with age, becoming more complex over time.
A9.com, a subsidiary of Amazon, develops the company’s search engine advertising technology. However, it is not a functioning brand anymore.
The [Amazon A9 algorithm](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-a9-algorithm/) is a powerful aspect for sellers to consider finding their way up the rankings. It is a search methodology that quickly reads and analyzes all the data on the marketplace to provide you with some of the best possible product choices. This AI-based framework ranks products with relevant matches for a customer’s query at the top of its results page. One principle it follows is relevancy: to rank higher, one must optimize their listings for SEO and make sure they have strong relevance when customers are searching.
The Amazon ranking algorithm adapts to the search patterns of its customers, displaying what they are looking for most. The structured data in their catalog allows them to combine different relevant features and displays search results tailored specifically for individual shoppers. The algorithm also learns from its former search patterns and adapts to display important results to its customers.
### **Factors that determine A9 Algorithm**
Although it’s hard to find information on how exactly their A9 algorithm works, we have identified various factors that play into the success of your conversions and sales of product listings. These aspects are:
#### Parent-Child Products
Amazon’s built-in parent/child product functionality is a great way to display variations of the same products as opposed to displaying them with different listings. This means that you can expect your customer to find the products on a single page. Variation themes include color/name, size/count, and scent, among others! For example, identical t-shirts which vary only by their color; lipstick available in various shades; etc. With Amazon’s ranking system, products with multiple options in their listing tend to rank higher than those without.
Another benefit of doing this includes higher ranking chances on product searches due to multiple options being shown. With customers staying in the same place and viewing all other products together, there’s an increased chance they will make a purchase!
#### Text-Match Relevance
Relevancy is what shapes the content of a product listing. It’s like an intrinsic ranking system that factors in keywords, descriptions, and even bullet points to calculate how “relevant” your items are for any given search term or keyword.
The relevancy of the content is a vital factor in rankings. The better it matches, the higher up on the list you’ll see them! Creative titles and keyword-rich descriptions are important for getting your listing to rank high – but make sure they’re engaging too.
#### Sales Velocity
This is another significant factor that the A9 algorithm considers while determining the product rankings. To keep the marketplace competitive, it compares the seller’s transactions and dollar amounts with their competitors and ranks them accordingly. The seller with the highest sales velocity wins out.
Amazon calculates both dollar volume (the amount) and quantity of items per transaction (number). Both are important factors taken into consideration to determine who earns top rankings on their site.
#### Stock Availability
Ever wondered why your Amazon product listings disappear from the top rankings? Well, the algorithm that ranks your listing takes into account whether an item is in stock. If there’s no availability for a product, then chances are your ranking will be downgraded and customers won’t find your products. On the other hand, running out of stock negatively impacts your Amazon account health too.
Running low on inventory also negatively impacts your seller performance rating which eventually leads to lower sale volume–so don’t wait any longer to restock those shelves!
#### Pricing
A9 is a tricky algorithm. Besides displaying the [top-selling and relevant products](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-best-selling-products/), it also checks if a product has been priced appropriately. It looks at the best price and looks at how well your amazon product listing has been represented. So, try to balance these aspects.
#### FBA
The [FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/fba-amazon/) is one of the most valuable resources for sellers. The fulfillment-by-Amazon program allows merchants who use their services to stock their products at all or some of [Amazon’s warehouses](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-fba-warehouses/) within its geographical proximity. This produces two benefits:
* A Featured Merchant Status which increases exposure on The Search Page.
* An Increased Possibility To Win The Buy Box.
This, in turn, increases your sales velocity and improves conversion rates as FBA has plenty of benefits. Some of them are easy to return policy, shorter delivery dates, accountability, etc.
#### Advertising
Sales velocity is yet another most vital factor that Amazon’s A9 search algorithm looks for. But the question is how to increase your sales velocity? Well, the answer is through “advertising.” Even a few dollars allotted for advertising can do a big deed in [driving visitors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izhnT1f90yI&t=3s) to your product listings. And if the product is impressive enough, you get to generate more sales.
#### Customer Reviews
Undeniably, reviews play a key role in enhancing overall sales. [Positive ratings and reviews](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/get-more-amazon-product-reviews-legally/) from customers help the A9 algorithm to determine whether buyers are engaging positively or not. To outshine your competitors with this part of the marketing strategy, create an incredible customer experience for visitors browsing through your listings. Engage them by providing answers to them in the Q&A section of your product listings. Attempt for favorable and good reviews while mitigating and minimizing the negative feedback.
#### High-Resolution Images
Images are everything in an online marketplace where buyers cannot interact with the product physically. Bright, clear, high-quality pictures of a product enhance conversion rates and appeal to Amazon’s A9 algorithm so your listing ranks higher on search results pages. Upload as many as acceptable images, taken from all angles, as this appeases the A9 algorithm to boost rankings, as well as shoppers to provide them with a wide selection of views before they buy. [AI photo editor](https://skylum.com/luminar-ai) tools can greatly improve the visual appeal of your Amazon product listing.
Amazon’s recommendation is to have at least 1280 pixels on the longest side. Ideally, you should go for ultra-HD images that have 2560 pixels (or more) on the longest side. You can also try images with 3D rendering or an [AI image generator](https://picsart.com/ai-image-generator/) which instantly create unique images that fit your brand aesthetic. These images give authentic appeal to your visitors.
#### Promotions
There are many ways to boost sales velocity and increase conversions, but promotions can provide a quick bump in sales. However, it’s not a long-term strategy. Discounting your product may provide you with an immediate boost in sales and conversions, but you should be very careful while offering them as discounts often have negative effects on rankings. There are many others more important, more sustainable “A9” factors to focus on – such as your text match relevancy and product availability.
#### Amazon A+ Content
Amazon says that [A+ content](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-a-plus-content/) helps increase the overall sales of a product by 3 – 10% on average. The increase is because buyers have higher customer satisfaction with products when they know more about them.
A study performed by [MediaMind](http://www.iab.net/media/file/MediaMindRichPowerfulResearch.pdf), where they analyzed 24,000 websites, which experienced about 12 billion impressions during July & December and discovered that multimedia content helped boost impressions by 3x.
When it comes to Amazon product listing, there are six elements associated with it. Be it a private label or [retail arbitrage](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-retail-arbitrage/), these aspects are important to understand as a third-party seller:
* Product Image
* Product Title
* Product Description
* Product Features
* Product Ratings
* Product Reviews
#### Brand and Manufacturer
The benefits of including the brand name when listing on Amazon are many. Besides coming up in filter results, customers will also search for your product by specific brands and manufacturers to find what they’re looking for much more quickly than if you didn’t include it.
Amazon does not show products that do not mention a manufacturer or brand. Therefore, for the ultimate success of your product, make sure to include a mention of your brand or manufacturer. This will help you get on Amazon’s radar and ensure that customers searching for products like yours can find them effortlessly!
Make sure to follow the guidelines for every element related to your product listings, followed by optimizing and improving them to make them convert. This helps you outrank your competitors, add value, and increase your customer base.
#### Category
A customer that wants to purchase a product in the same category may not find you if your listing is too broad. When adding information about products, make sure you list them under their most specific category possible for them to locate your product listings effortlessly.

## **How did we ensure the best Amazon Product Listing Optimization?**
What does it take to have a top-performing listing? At SellerApp, we found that out by comparing two listings, one of which had well-optimized features and the other did not. With our [set of amazon tools](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-free-tools.html), we not only figured them out but also will explain the key tricks to optimize to improve your rankings.
So what did we do? We took one product listing from Amazon and analyzed how it performed so well. Here’s what we discovered:
There are nine sets of parameters that can break or boost the process of Amazon Product listing optimization. They are:
* Listing quality
* Keywords they used
* Number of images they used
* ASIN index
* Number of characters used in the product title
* The way bullet points were featured
* The way the product was described
* Number of reviews and ratings it had
* Whether it was Fulfilled by Amazon or not
Let’s dive deeper into each parameter and see what made it so successful.
## **How To Optimize Your Amazon Product Listings?**
By ranking higher in Amazon search results, you can increase your sales and add to the bottom line. But how do we rank high? There are many factors that go into a successful product listing such as optimizing for keywords, having quality photos with good lighting, writing an optimized title & description, and more! Let’s dive deeper into some of these important aspects, so you can have all the tools necessary to succeed on this platform.
**When we talk about “optimization,” we stress two things here:**
* Optimized with potential keywords to help rank for [search terms that buyers search for.](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/optimize-amazon-search-term/)
* Optimized with the right set of images, title, and description to generate greater conversion rates.
Now, what most sellers tend to forget is the concept behind Amazon’s A9 algorithm. Even though you have an incredible listing that is well optimized for Amazon, if a buyer feels that “it isn’t good,” then he or she is not going to buy it. This is obvious.
**It isn’t just about an optimized product listing. It is also about your product’s quality, its features, and what customers think about it. Everything has to come together to make your listing successful.**
When you say “optimization,” it is not only about accomplishing higher rankings on Amazon’s search results. It is also about building a better and rewarding product overall.
Now, before you could actually get into the actual “optimization,” there is an important step that you need to do, which is **keyword research**.
### **First, perform a keyword research**
Though you have Google Keyword Planner handy, it is best to have a [keyword tool](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-keyword-search.html) that only gives the stats of what buyers are searching on Amazon’s search box. Though this is completely your freedom of what you want to go with, our “keyword research” feature can discover some top-searched keywords on Amazon in no time.
You can search for potential keywords based on the product that you are selling. Type the product category or product that you are selling on Amazon.
Perform Keyword Research. You will get a detailed list of keywords associated with what you have typed and its stats.
You can even track a few related products if you want to. The tool is that simple. It also allows you to search for long-tail keywords, and it’s difficult to rank on Amazon. Once you decided what keywords you want to target, the next step is to optimize your listing.
### **Amazon Product Listing Optimization**
Here is a list of parameters you must focus on to optimize your product listing. Make sure to follow them diligently and watch your ranking skyrocket in no time.
#### **Number of Product Images**
Make sure that your product images are clear and high quality to help you convert. But how many should you include? You need a strategy for your product images and 62% of the top listings tend to have at least 5 or 8. According to [SellerApp’s findings](https://www.sellerapp.com/), the sweet spot is 6 images.
This was the product listing we took from Amazon and did a complete analysis on its images first.
**Why is this considered the best Amazon product listing example?**
This product generates an estimated sale of 43 to 61 on a daily basis, with a decent revenue. Though multiple factors call for it, the product image is one of them. You can evaluate your Amazon product image quality using the following criteria:
* Close-up and clear shots of the images
* Images shouldn’t be blurred
* The product should be well lit and properly focused
* The product must be easily recognizable
* The product should occupy 80% of the space provided
**Besides providing quality images, include as many pictures as possible. Also, note that many product categories let you include swatch & alternate images. Though Amazon allows you to upload 9 images, we recommend you to stay around 5 – 6.**
Ensure that the main pictures are on a clear, white background. However, the background for others can be clean and simple. You can also use lifestyle images to provide a better understanding of the product and its features. Follow these dos and don’ts for an optimum product image for your product listing –
**Do:**
* Every image should be clicked in bright white light.
* Focus the product in the center.
* The main image should only include the main product. It shouldn’t have accessories, boxes, or other items with it.
* Keep the image background white.
* Make sure that the image is large enough to allow the zoom function to work.
* Include a tagline to explain the durability of the product.
* Include an infographic about the product’s benefits to help generate more sales.
* Make sure to use only the JPEG (.jpg) file format.
* Keep the resolution 72 pixels per inch with a minimum size of 1000 pixels (for the longest side).
**Don’t:**
* Include logos, texts, or watermarks on the images.
* Show multiple pictures if the product is a multipack.
* Include background on the main image. But it is okay if you are doing it for any other secondary image.
* Show various views of a product in the main image.
* Include accessories and other things that you are not selling with your product.
#### **Product Title**
There is a correlation between the length of your product’s title and how well it sells. We analyzed our sales data to see what words are most effective in generating interest for products over others. Surprisingly, there was an established relationship between these two factors! What does this mean? Amazon will take into account those first five words when creating URLs which means they can be more relevant if you have them at the beginning- especially since that part makes up about 80% of titles on search engine results pages (SERPs).
The “canonical URL” is generated by taking each word from its corresponding listing’s title with a few exceptions: stop words such as “a,” “and,” etc.
How to ensure your product title is up to the mark?
Follow these simple tips to optimize your product listing title-
**Do’s**
* Your listing should contain at least 80 characters. For a better user experience, make sure the character limit ranges from 100-150 characters.
* Include potential keywords in the title but use dashes (-) or pipes (|) to break the keywords. This improves readability and doesn’t look confusing.
* Include color, model number, series, and quantity (if required).
* If the product is a multi pack. Mention the quantity. Example: 15-pack, set of 5, etc.
* Integrate your keywords. Make sure to use relevant keywords to ensure your listing appears before relevant leads.
* Address user intent. Your product title should align with the type of audience you are catering to.
* Considering that the amazon product title character limit is 200, don’t waste your valuable space adding irrelevant words.
* Capitalize the first letter of each word in your product title.
* Use numeric values instead of spelling numbers out, for example, 7 instead of seven.
* Spell out measurements such as pound, inch, feet, etc.
**Don’ts**
* Capitalize all the words in the title.
* Include particular details of your listing. Example: Free shipping.
* Include subjective adjectives like “fantastic, awesome, great, etc.”
* Use special characters or HTML tags.
* Include too much information. Do not overstuff with keywords.
Look at the example below to have a more vivid understanding of how you must frame your product title.
![amazon product listing requirements](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-product-listing.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 3")
Hence, it is vital to take some time to work on the titles because it is one of the crucial factors that decide its **CTR (Click-through Rate)** on the results page.
#### **Product Description**
[Amazon product description](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-product-description-editor.html) is one of the most crucial parts of Amazon product listing optimization. A great product description is a key to success. It can help you sell more and rank higher in search engines for your products or services – but only if it’s done well!
If a buyer gets to your product description, he/she is more likely to purchase your product, however, they are still not sure yet.
Different experts have different opinions in making a great description. But what it actually takes to create one? Well, it all comes down to creativity and optimization. A blend of both can improve rankings and convert better.
The description has a direct impact on the customers. Tell them why you are selling the product for so much? Try convincing the buyers how your product can make a difference in their day-to-day lives and why is it important to buy it from you rather than your competitors.
Look at the example below to understand better:
![how to write amazon product listing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-product-listing-guidelines.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 4")
The product description above has all the relevant points mentioned, they have not only kept it short and crisp but also made it precise and easy to understand. Here are some guidelines you must follow while curating the perfect Amazon product description:
**Do:**
* Keep it short, clear, and precise.
* Give descriptive and factual information.
* Highlight the important features.
* Capitalize the first letter of every sentence.
* Give a page break when writing a new paragraph.
* Check for grammatical and spelling errors.
* Include the brand name, model number, and series even if they are used in the title already.
* Include color, size, and compatibility information.
**Don’t:**
* Use time-sensitive or subjective terms like “hot-selling this year, great value, etc.”
* Include shipping or promotional information.
* Use HTML tags.
* Include email or web address here.
* Use symbols or special characters.
**A product description should be concise, clear, and should be clear in explaining what your product does. We recommend keeping it a minimum of 250 words. But don’t make it too long either.**
#### **Product Features**
Product features are one of the significant elements in a product listing, and they’re usually listed using **[amazon bullet points](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-bullet-points/)** rather than chunks of texts or large paragraphs. This is because it simplifies things, making it way easier to read than a paragraph full of texts.
Look at the example below to understand better how it’s done –
![amazon product listing requirements](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-listing-guidelines.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 5")
**Upon analyzing, we also found that most top sellers on Amazon not only use bullet points to write their product’s features but also don’t overdo it. They do not exceed 5 bullet points.**
The bullet points must include every important feature that distinguishes you from your competitors. Keep it interesting and convincing enough for a buyer to make a purchase.
Follow the below-mentioned guidelines for an optimized product features list –
**Do:**
* List the most important feature of your product on the first two points followed by the less important ones.
* Use only 5 bullet points. However, if it is really important to write a little, extend to 6 but not more than that.
* Incorporate call-to-action words in these points.
* Make sure that the first letter of every bullet point is capitalized.
* Include points that help distinguish your product from your competitors.
* Use a few keywords. But don’t just shove them. It should make sense while reading.
**Don’t:**
* Use too many keywords unnecessarily.
* Use exclamation marks to 3-4 full stops.
* Use too many bullet points.
* Use special characters or HTML tags.
* Include shipping or promotional information in bullet points.
* Include time-sensitive or subjective comments like “hot-selling” or “great value.”
* Use terms like “unique design, stand out from the crowd, etc.”
#### **Product Ratings**
The reviews of a product have an immense impact on the ratings. They go hand in hand with each other, thus if you want to make sure that your rating is high then you should focus not only on producing quality products but also on having good customer service and responding quickly to any complaints or problems they might be facing as well! The below listing has 4.3 out of 5 stars which is certainly a fabulous score, but there’s still plenty more room for improvement so don’t give up yet.
![what is amazon product listing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-amazon-listing-examples.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 6")
Now, if you happen to be in the realm of 4-5 stars, it means that your products are performing really well. However, if your product struggles and has very fewer ratings, here is what you can do to improve:
* Look for patterns in bad or negative reviews. What’s the common thing that your customers are complaining about?
* Then, come up with an idea or solution to fix it.
* Gather as much feedback as you can via email campaigns (automated) because this can, at times, help you resolve the issue before a customer leaves a bad review.
* Accumulate as many reviews as possible and balance them so that you can have a good rating and review overall.
#### **Manage Product Reviews**
It is clear that online shoppers rely on product reviews. Hence, it’s important to encourage your customers – and leave their honest opinions about the products you offer. Here are some interesting facts from experts: Products with 4.3 stars and 400 reviews are certain to perform better (in terms of sales) than products with even 4.8 ratings and 14 reviews. In general, a successful product listing tends to have between 500 and 1000 reviews. Generating a good amount of sales on a daily basis.
More info: [Amazon’s Generative AI: How It Can Help in Amazon Product Listing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/enhance-your-product-listings-with-amazons-generative-ai/)
![amazon product listing guide](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/product-listing-on-amazon.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 7")
You can use [Amazon’s Reviewer program](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-reviewer.html) to gather a few initial reviews. Furthermore, you can opt for Amazon’s Request a Review and request your buyer to review your product within 4-20 days from the time they bought the product.
### **How to improve product reviews?**
**Step 1:** Ask for product reviews: According to Amazon, it is not permitted for sellers and manufacturers to offer rewards in return for reviews. However, you can ask buyers or anyone who has ordered your product in the past few months if they would be willing to post their thoughts about a purchase without incentives. Email them after their delivery arrives at their destination to provide feedback.
**Step 2:** Request Removal of Fake reviews/non-seller-related issues: Reviews are a crucial part of the online shopping experience, but not all reviews have to do with products. Reviews sometimes reflect issues that relate to services such as shipping and customer support inquiries; therefore, such reviews can be requested to be removed.
**Step 3:** Respond to messages promptly: [Amazon’s Buy Box](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/how-to-price-right-to-win-the-buy-box/) algorithm takes into account customer response time when determining the seller who gets the top ranking. Aim to respond to all messages from customers within 24 hours and ideally as soon as possible for best results!
##### **Search Terms**
The section – search terms – is shown only in the listing’s back-end. There is still a lot of discussion around this part, but it isn’t that complicated. All you have to do is to put your main keywords, **one per line.**
**Do:**
* Use other primary keywords that you couldn’t use in the product title.
* Include a few other secondary search terms.
* Use abbreviations, misspellings, and applications of the product or any other variant.
**Don’t:**
* Include keywords that you have already used in the title.
* Use brand name again here because Amazon will pick this up automatically.
* Use subjective terms like “available now, best, on sale, etc.”
* Use the seller’s name.
#### **Reduce Exit Rate**
Amazon’s customer experience is all about keeping customers engaged. Even if they just viewed your product and left the store, their exit rate will already be higher than it should. The key to combat this issue? Keep them interested in relevant products – you never know when that might change a mind! Not to mention, if your exit rate is too high, your product ranking will decline, causing your sales volume to drop drastically.
## **How To List A New Product On Amazon?**
Amazon product listing involves two things, which you must always keep in mind:
* If you sell your own product, you should create a new listing on Amazon. This means that you are the first seller to sell that product in the Amazon Marketplace.
* If you have multiple merchants selling the same item that you do, then they share a common Amazon listing. You have to use the same and shouldn’t create a new listing for it.
### **Steps to create a new listing:**
**Step 1:** Log in to your seller central account and go to the dashboard.
**Step 2:** On the main menu, click on “Inventory.”
**Step 3:** A sub-menu pops up. Click “Add a Product” from the list.
**Step 4:** You will be redirected to a detailed page where you can add the product.
![amazon listing rules](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-product-description-guidelines.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 8")
**Step 5:** Here, you will have the choice to either select an existing item or create your own. You can search from Amazon’s catalog or choose to **add a new product that is not sold on Amazon.**
**Step 6:** Select the product category and subcategorize to classify the item that you sell. If you feel that your product can be listed under two categories, then look at the other sellers and see in which category they are listing their products.
![amazon product listing and content guide](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-listing-optimization.jpg "Amazon Product Listings Optimization & Guidelines For Increased Traffic 9")
**Step 7:** Once you select the appropriate product category, you will be enabled to fill in the product listing’s information.
**Step 8:** You will be asked to fill in the product title, product description, product images, and so on. Now, this is the part that can make or break your listing. The details that you give should be engaging and yet informative. Most importantly, it should be convincing enough for the buyers to purchase your product.
**Step 9:** You will have to fill details in every tab named *Variations, Offer, Images, Description, Keywords*, etc. If you see a red warning symbol on any of these tabs, it signifies that you have missed entering the essential details required to make the listing available on Amazon Marketplace. Until you don’t do this, your listing will not be published.
If you still face issues in publishing the product listing, you can always contact the [Amazon Seller Support team](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seller-support-contact-number/) by clicking on the link – “Help” on the top, right side of the page. Follow the necessary steps to get assistance for the issue.
### **Amazon Product Video Guidelines**
Amazon shoppers love it when there’s a video included for the product. A recent survey found that [90% of them](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-only-marketing-strategy-you-need/) say videos featuring the products help them in making their decision, and those listings with videos have higher conversion rates because they allow buyers to see how well your product works.
Adding videos to your product listing is an intelligent move and one of the best ways to convince shoppers to purchase something from your store or website, depending on how much time they put into finding it online before pulling their trigger.
Now, as a seller, if you are trying to add a product video to your listing along with the images, then it is simple. But first, learn what type of videos are there and what each type contributes to.
### **Types of product videos that you can create:**
Generally, there are 3 types of video concepts that you can create to help your product reach the right audience and keep them engaged.
* **Product Highlighter Video:** This type of video is clean, simple, and features completely on the product. They are usually a 360° video with the product on a plain, white background.
* **Customer Experience Video:** This type of video is usually captured by the reviewers, fans, or customers. It offers a realistic experience for other buyers to comprehend the product better.
* **Product Explanatory Video:** This type of video is of impeccable quality with an engaging script and explains the benefits of using the product.
**Note: You can add a video to Amazon listing in the following ways:**
* [A+ Content Manager (Enhanced Brand Content](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-enhanced-brand-content/)) – Professional sellers who are brand-registered can access A+ content manager and add a video
* [Amazon vendor central](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-vendor-central-pricing/) – Adding videos with Amazon vendor central can be hard as it is an invite-only program.
* Adding video with customer reviews – Getting good video reviews from your customer has the ability to provide a positive impact on your product listing.

* The product video **cannot contain perverse or offensive content**.
Bear in mind that Amazon keeps updating its product video guidelines. So, make sure to look at the EBC’s help page or directly go to the link that says *Video Guidelines* within the EBC UI.
#### **How To Add A Product Video On Amazon?**
Adding a product video is simple, given that you have been enabled to use this option. Follow these step-by-step guidelines:
* **Step 1:** Log in to your Amazon Seller Central account.
* **Step 2:** Go to *Advertising* and click on A+ content manager.
* **Step 3:** Search for your product’s SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).
* **Step 4:** Click on the button “Get started” to add the video to the respective ASIN.
* **Step 5:** Upload the video file.
* **Step 6:** Add the thumbnail for the product video, title, and description.
* **Step 7:** If the uploaded video includes content that isn’t appropriate for audiences under the age of 18 years, then make sure to select the box that says – “adult audience.”
* **Step 8:** The process of adding a product video is now done.
It takes a maximum of 6 hours for the video to be available on the product’s page. Once it is published, it shows up on the image block on the upper left pane, and again, in the *related videos* under the product’s information section.
**If you want to remove the product video from the page, do this:**
* **Step 1:** Go to the EBC dashboard.
* **Step 2:** Look for a box that says “delete the video from the detail page.”
* **Step 3:** Submit the required changes.
* **Step 4:** Once submitted, your uploaded product video will be removed in 6 hours.
## **How does product listing optimization impact customer decision journey?**
You’ve probably heard of the term, “consumer decision journey.” Well, this is what we are going to discuss today! The consumer decision journey is a process where consumers decide which product they want to purchase for themselves or others based on their needs and wants. Sellers have four important elements that need improvement in order for them to be successful: availability, findability, [conversion rate](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-conversion-rate-guide/) optimization (CRO), and post-purchase experience.
The importance of Amazon Listing Optimization cannot be discussed without also discussing the Consumer Decision Journey, as they both rely on each other for success (or lack thereof). Let’s decipher how product listing optimization comes into play at every step of the customer decision journey –
### **Availability**
Availability is the first key factor when it comes to optimizing your Amazon listings. When deciding on what factors are important, there are two that you need to consider: inventory availability and Buy Box ownership. You might have a collection of the most optimum keywords or the best product images, but if your product listing gets suppressed due to low or no inventory stocks, nothing can help you rank high.
One of the [best ways to minimize returns](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/how-to-turn-amazon-customer-returns-into-profit/) and dissatisfaction from customers is owning the ‘Buy Box’. When you own it, your store creates a product listing that customers are more likely to see while shopping on Amazon than listings created by other sellers.
### **Findability**
Amazon is a fickle beast, but there are ways that you can make your products more findable. The first step to optimizing your Amazon listing is making sure everything’s in stock, and you’ve won the [Buy Box](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-buy-box/). Once you have taken care of these, focusing on “findability” is the next crucial thing to do.
One of the most important factors in [Amazon’s ranking algorithm](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-a10-algorithm-updates/) is your findability. Findability encompasses both organic and advertising presence, meaning that not only should you be making sure to rank for keywords within your product category but also ensuring that people can easily navigate your products.
This means that you have to evaluate the most searched terms that are relevant to your product listing and add them to your product title, description, and features. It is also important to include them in backend keywords and alternate text in images.
### **Conversion**
As a study by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/page-fold-manifesto/) shows, “Users do scroll but only if what’s above the fold is promising enough”, this means that your above-the-fold content is one of the crucial aspects that has the ability to create a conversion funnel and this includes your title and image list. Make sure to use the best keywords for your product listing title and insert high-resolution images.
Below the fold, you’re given more creative control and can dive deeper into your product. If consumers are 90% sold on a purchase based on what they see above, then with below-the-fold content shoppers will find additional videos of their products in action, A+ content, as well as reviews from other customers who have purchased them before.
### **Post-Purchase**
Optimizing your Amazon listings doesn’t end with conversion. Customer Satisfaction is an important aspect of product listing optimization. You want them to have a good experience both on the product side and the seller storefront, which can be seen in reviews of their products.
A positive indication of a developed post-purchase process is repeat customers, i.e. customer retention. Not only does this show customer satisfaction from the product side, but also on your seller storefront through quick and professional responses to all questions or complaints.
#### **Conclusion**
There’s a reason why Amazon is the largest [online retailer](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/online-arbitrage-vs-retail-arbitrage/) in the world. People around the globe use it to search for products 3 times as often as they do Google! It’s important that this site has perfect algorithms, so their best items are shown after every search. Therefore, optimizing your product listing to match the A9 algorithms is very important to stand out amongst millions of competitors there.
The way you present your product on Amazon – both through listing content and the user experience after purchase, can make or break a sale. Creating engaging listing pages that provide all the information customers need to feel confident in their purchases is imperative for a product listing to rank top on Amazon searches.

## Overview
Discover how to build your e-commerce business, optimize listings, and maximize profits through effective third-party selling on Amazon Marketplace.
The Amazon Marketplace has revolutionized retail by allowing independent sellers to reach millions of customers worldwide. With over [9.7 million registered sellers](https://www.shiprocket.in/blog/ten-amazon-statistics/#:~:text=Number%20of%20Sellers%20on%20Amazon,million%20are%20actively%20selling%20products.) and approximately 1.9 million actively selling products, the opportunity to build a profitable business is substantial.
Success in the Amazon Marketplace requires knowledge, strategy, and practical application—principles that align perfectly with hands-on business education. Let's explore how you can transform theoretical understanding into real-world success through third-party selling.
[Apply your entrepreneurial skills in a global business program with Tetr](https://tetr.com/ug-programme)
#### What Is Amazon Marketplace?
The [Amazon Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/what-is-marketplace.html) functions as a platform where independent sellers can list and sell products directly to Amazon customers. Unlike traditional retail where Amazon purchases and resells products, third-party selling allows entrepreneurs to maintain control over inventory, pricing, and business strategies while leveraging Amazon's massive customer base with over [310 million active users](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-statistics/#:~:text=1%20.-,Amazon%20Has%20Over%20310%20Million%20Active%20Users%20Globally,unique%20monthly%20visitors%20in%202023.) globally.
When a customer purchases a product from a third-party seller, the transaction occurs on Amazon's website, creating a seamless experience for buyers. However, as a seller, you maintain ownership of the products and control over critical business decisions, sharing only a portion of the sale with Amazon as fees.
#### Getting Started with Third-Party Selling on Amazon
Establishing your presence on the Amazon Marketplace requires several strategic decisions:
First, you'll need to create a seller account.
Amazon offers two selling plans, [Individual & Professional.](https://www.smartscout.com/blog/professional-vs-individual-seller-plan)
The Individual plan ($0.99 per item sold plus referral fees) works best if you plan to sell fewer than 40 items monthly and prefer a per-sale fee structure.
The Professional plan ($39.99 monthly plus referral fees) provides additional tools and features that benefit higher-volume sellers.
Your selling strategy should account for various fee types that impact your profitability:
* Referral fees (percentage of each sale, varying by category)
* Closing fees (additional charges based on product price)
* Shipping fees (dependent on your fulfillment method)
* Other potential costs like storage or FBA fees

#### Creating Compelling Product Listings
Your product listings serve as virtual storefronts, making optimization crucial for marketplace success. Strong Amazon Seller Strategies begin with creating listings that convert browsers to buyers.
Product titles should contain relevant keywords while remaining readable and clear. Avoid keyword stuffing, which can negatively impact both customer experience and search performance.
High-quality images significantly impact conversion rates.
Detailed product descriptions address customer questions before they arise. Focus on communicating benefits rather than just features, and ensure specifications are accurate to prevent returns and negative reviews.
When optimizing listings, consider these elements that influence customer decisions:
* Complete and accurate product details that help customers compare options
* High-resolution images that showcase product features clearly
* Descriptive, helpful titles that summarize the product effectively
* Comprehensive bullet points highlighting key benefits and features
Many successful sellers report that investing time in creating detailed, accurate listings results in higher conversion rates and fewer customer service issues.
#### Fulfillment Strategies for Third-Party Sellers
How you deliver products to customers significantly impacts both customer satisfaction and your operational efficiency. The Amazon Marketplace offers several fulfillment options.
[Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)](https://sell.amazon.in/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillment-by-amazon) allows you to ship inventory to Amazon's warehouses, where they handle storage, packing, shipping, and customer service. Products eligible for Prime shipping and often leads to higher visibility in search results.
When using FBA, you benefit from:
* Amazon's established logistics network
* Prime eligibility for your products
* Customer service and returns handled by Amazon
* Often higher conversion rates due to customer trust in Prime shipping
Alternatively, Merchant Fulfilled Network (MFN) or "Seller Fulfilled Prime" gives you control over warehousing and shipping while maintaining Prime eligibility if you meet Amazon's strict delivery requirements.

#### Building Long-Term Success Through Brand Development
Creating a recognizable brand is crucial for long-term success in Third-Party Selling on Amazon. While individual product listings matter, building a cohesive brand identity creates customer loyalty beyond single transactions.
Brand development on Amazon starts with consistency across all listings. Maintain uniform photography styles, consistent messaging, and reliable customer service to establish brand recognition.
Amazon Brand Registry provides additional tools for registered trademarks, including enhanced content options and greater protection against counterfeit products. Offering significant advantages for serious sellers looking to build legitimate brands.
Your brand's reputation ultimately depends on customer experience. Focusing on accurate product descriptions, quality control, and responsive customer service builds trust that drives repeat business.

#### Frequently Asked Questions
What's the difference between first-party and third-party selling on Amazon?
First-party (1P) sellers function as wholesale suppliers selling products to Amazon, which then resells them. Third-party (3P) sellers maintain ownership of their products and control pricing while using Amazon's platform to reach customers.
How much does it cost to start selling on Amazon?
Costs vary based on your selling plan. The Individual plan has no monthly fee but charges $0.99 per item sold plus referral fees. The Professional plan costs $39.99 monthly plus referral fees, which typically range from 8% to 15% depending on the category.
Is Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) worth the extra cost?
For many sellers, [FBA's](https://sell.amazon.in/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillment-by-amazon) benefits outweigh its costs. FBA products often see higher conversion rates due to Prime eligibility, and the service eliminates logistical headaches. Over 80% of Amazon sellers choose FBA despite its additional fees.
What are the most common mistakes new Amazon sellers make?
New sellers often underestimate competition, create incomplete product listings, price products incorrectly, mismanage inventory, and neglect customer feedback. Addressing these areas can significantly improve performance.
How can I make my Amazon listings stand out from competitors?
Create distinct product listings with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and accurate specifications. Focus on communicating unique benefits, maintain competitive pricing, and actively manage customer reviews to build a strong reputation.

### **2. Check Best Sellers Rank**
Look for each product’s [Best Sellers Rank (BSR)](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-best-sellers-rank)to gauge demand. To research manually, type product keywords in the Amazon search bar to get page-one results.
To start, you can look in a listing’s “Productdetails” section, find a product’s BSR, and take detailed notes. Some products have more than one BSR if they appear in multiple categories.

## How to get started with your product idea
Even with the best product ideas, you don’t want to run into issues procuring, listing, or getting them to customers. Before you decide what to sell, consider how you’ll:
1. Source products
2. Get products to customers
3. List products to drive traffic
4. Share products with customers online
5. Market products to boost sales
Let’s explore some these points and how they can play into your business strategy.
### 1. Procurement: Sourcing products
After you’ve narrowed down what to sell, the next step is figuring out how you’ll source products.
As an online business owner, you have several options. Will you resell existing products? Or maybe you plan to make your own products? Another option is working with a manufacturer to make products according to your specifications, or produce branded items.
Different procurement methods come with different considerations. Learn about some of the ins and outs with our [ecommerce business guide](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/start-ecommerce-business).

### 2. Fulfillment: Considering shipping options
How will customers get their orders? Amazon sellers have several fulfillment options:
#### Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
* Send products to the Amazon fulfillment network, where we pick, pack, ship, and provide customer service.
* Take advantage of specialized services like [Pan-European FBA](https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/fba-international), [FBA Export](https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/fba-international), and [Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MFC)](https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/fba-multi-channel).

# 4 Amazon Selling Tips You Probably Haven’t Tried Yet
If you’re like most e-commerce entrepreneurs, you know the things that got you where you are with your Amazon business today won’t be the same things that take you where you want to go tomorrow.
The game is changing all the time. Once you’ve achieved a dominant position in your niche, it’s time to move from hacks to real growth strategies that work in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
Whether you’re looking to scale up to an exit, or go from a seven- to eight-figure business, even the most successful Amazon sellers can always refine their strategies.
## 1. Expand Your Product Selection
In the early days, you could win the Buy Box just by moving a thousand units per day — but that was then.
Success on Amazon in the 2020s requires an agile strategy focused not solely on sales, but all things growth. Product line expansion is [one of the best ways](https://www.webgility.com/blog/the-large-amazon-sellers-guide-to-expanding-your-product-line) to make that happen.
By growing your product portfolio, you not only grow your sales volume.
You also put yourself in a prime position to capture other important types of growth, including:
* **Share growth:** Offering products that [attract customers away from your competitors](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/competitive-intelligence/), expanding your customer base.
* **Market growth:** Introducing products that attract new customers to your industry or category, driving overall market growth.
* **Price growth:** Implementing [price increases](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/ecommerce-inflation-and-pricing/) to boost revenue and profit margins.
* **Quantity growth:** Selling higher quantities of your products, whether through larger orders or increased demand.
* **Cost-cutting:** Identifying opportunities to lower production costs and [optimize your profitability](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-good-profit-margin-in-ecommerce/).
If you’re using a product research tool like Cerebro, Black Box, or Xray to generate product ideas, try filtering for products with less than three variations to see where there might be new gaps or opportunities in your category.
By broadening your focus from one or two bestsellers to a portfolio of products that can be strategically adjusted, you can achieve growth through multiple avenues as the business evolves.
For example, if you’re already launching the latest iPad cover in black, you could look into new colors or patterns based on what’s trending in the fashion world. When the demand for cases designed for older iPads begins to wane, you can discontinue every color except black and offer shoppers the option to purchase used cases. This will help reduce costs and avoid dead stock, while keeping your store in a prime position on Amazon.
### Bonus Tip: Make sure your current product listings are in tip-top shape.
Before you start adding a whole new line of products to your portfolio, take time to make sure all listings for your existing Amazon products are fully optimized. Check that your product titles are aligned with the latest [search engine optimization (SEO) best practices](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-listings-google/) and backed up by [plenty of positive reviews](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-seller-the-importance-of-customers-reviews-and-how-to-get-them/). For a complete primer on optimizing your Amazon product listings, our 7 Steps to Retail-Ready Listings guide has you covered.
## 2. Take Advantage of Strategic Product Bundling
With a wider range of products, you’re ready to tap into the power of product bundling and targeted cross-selling. Done right, this can be a powerful way to increase your average order value (AOV) and repeat purchases.
To start, review your data over the last year to see which products Amazon customers frequently purchase together. Once you’ve got your bundles ready, adjust your promotions inside Seller Central to maximize your [upselling and cross selling opportunities](https://www.gorillaroi.com/upselling-on-amazon/).
Here are some steps to get started:
* Leverage catalog and targeted cross promotions
* Use your images to visually communicate other products in the catalog
* Make sure your store’s URL is visible
* Take advantage of [Amazon Virtual Bundles](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/seller-forums/discussions/t/d231bce4-d878-4f01-84c5-ad4d8796fa2b)
The beauty of Amazon’s Virtual Product Bundle tool is that you don’t need a unique Universal Product Code (UPC) for the bundle. You can create virtual bundles of 2 to 5 Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) and immediately launch attractive offers that stand out.
With the right blend of products and promotions, you can accelerate the success of new or slow-moving products by letting them “piggyback” off your existing bestsellers.
Note that, as always, the rules are changing all the time. Before you launch your next bundle or cross promotion, take time to read and review Amazon’s latest guidelines on promotions and pricing.
### Bonus Tip: Align your selling strategy with your inventory strategy.
For Amazon FBA sellers of every shape and size, [going out of stock](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-out-of-stock/) can be devastating. As you add product categories, items, and bundles, it becomes even more important to make sure your marketing, pay-per-click (PPC) and promotion strategies are aligned with your available inventory levels. If it looks like you’re running out of stock faster than you can get new shipments into your Amazon fulfillment centers, adjust your promotion and marketing strategies to slow the pace of sales.
## 3. Add A+ Content (Especially Video)
Amazon A+ Content can lead to an average [conversion rate increase of 5.6%](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/ap/signin?clientContext=133-1360192-1571711&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fsellercentral.amazon.com%2Flearn%2Fcourses%3Fref_%3Dselleru_athena_c3_m46982f1c-0fde-4ad0-9d6c-5093711cb982%26courseId%3D3%26moduleId%3D46982f1c-0fde-4ad0-9d6c-5093711cb982%26modLanguage%3DEnglish%26contentType%3DDOCUMENT&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=sc_na_amazon_v2&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&mons_redirect=sign_in&ssoResponse=eyJ6aXAiOiJERUYiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwiYWxnIjoiQTI1NktXIn0.aUHFteZDiJ6UZQqcIlLeMgBZ4u2zRmF520NT0-slyobGeCwZxGaIbw.cmjqrFds_nC0YSZB.GrInYxMV_q8V32nx5SstbQsto-z3Cml3Z5G7k3kTtN30gN8UjPk_C5z-0cltKjTXoMo1X1bJxpVPPSCR-b1c_dMH3pyowe56zT5hBYdOF_lhuRtahbnvgTGEEiWFJo-p1hRJI9DpQEnd8XbAgX5jZVnFcLvUJy-e7VWj_Pp11nfMZrKuFRSFMRkszFpoHyvT99wWBLrHkQ.qopi9wA1wOPvfAy-180SMA) and even [increase your sales by up to 20%](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/BX_Marketing/Aplus_Best_Practice_Guide.pdf). For eligible [Brand Registered sellers](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-brand-registry/), you’ll see a notification in your [Amazon Seller account](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-seller-accounts/) letting you know whether you’ve been approved for this feature.
There are currently two types of A+ Content, Basic and Premium. Both offer up to five content modules per ASIN, with customizable layouts and formats for your product detail pages. Brands also get access to enhanced images, detailed product descriptions, comparison charts, technical specifications charts, and bullet points.
It also offers additional space to cross-sell and link to your [Amazon Storefront](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-storefronts-why-nows-the-time-to-get-started/), which is yet another way to increase repeat purchases and sales of bundled products.
Here are some tips for succeeding with Amazon A+ Content:
* **Focus on your unique strengths:** Utilize A+ Content and Brand Story to communicate your mission, values, and what makes you stand out from competitors.
* **Be descriptive about your products:** Use text and images to provide comprehensive product information to increase customer satisfaction while minimizing returns and negative customer reviews.
* **Use high-quality visuals:** Showcase your products with professional, high-resolution photos and graphics.
* **A/B test your A+ content:** Take advantage of Amazon’s Manage Your Experiments A/B testing tool to determine which images, text, and elements drive the best results. Make necessary adjustments to optimize your conversion rates.
* **Regularly monitor and update:** Keep your A+ Content current with the latest product details, features, and customer feedback to ensure its effectiveness over time.
One of the most exciting things about Amazon A+ content is the ability to integrate video into your product pages.
For example, in addition to dozens of high-quality images featuring its hero product in different settings, [CROSSNET’s store](https://www.amazon.com/stores/CROSSNET/CROSSNET/page/B2DABCE7-F6BC-4552-98F1-DDDF340A7CE0?ref_=cm_sw_r_ud_sf_stores_FKJA940NMNBS74573V17) also includes a professionally shot video highlighting its products in action. Considering that [64% of customers](https://www.oneday.com/blog/21-stats-that-prove-why-video-marketing-just-works) make purchases after viewing a brand’s videos, this is one area of your [A+ Content strategy](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/amazon-a-plus-content/) you definitely don’t want to overlook.
### Bonus Tip: Send your social media traffic to your Amazon store.
If you’ve already got a great social media following, experiment with ways to drive that traffic to your Amazon store. This is a great way to increase brand loyalty, without taking on the extra work of building out a DTC site.
## 4. Start Selling Globally
You already know the US is Amazon’s #1 market, but what many sellers still don’t realize is that you can make just as much sales in other markets as you can on Amazon US. This could involve taking on any number of new markets, including Canada, Mexico, Europe (especially Germany and the UK), Brazil, and more.
The beauty of using Amazon’s ecosystem to expand internationally is that you don’t have to go through the process of developing new products or learning a whole new channel.
The algorithm is the same. The fulfillment is the same. To some extent, you can copy/paste what already works on Amazon US and nearly double your sales simply by embracing a new market.
Here are some ways to start growing your revenue by selling internationally:
* Conduct research to identify promising international markets with high demand for your products
* Test the waters using your existing Amazon sales and fulfillment strategy
* Replicate the same strategies that worked in the US to dominate in your new market
Expanding internationally isn’t easy, but [with the right approach](https://sellersfi.com/resources/blog/international-expansion-ecommerce/), you can take advantage of your position as a big fish in a smaller pond.
### Bonus Tip: Localize your listings.
To effectively attract potential customers in other markets, you’ve got to go above and beyond translations. Start by conducting keyword research specific to the market, updating your Amazon SEO strategy to incorporate country or region-specific search terms, and using images that resonate with local users.
## Build the Selling Strategies that Work for You
Sponsored display ads and customer reviews might be good enough for dropshipping entrepreneurs and Amazon beginners, but as you grow your market share, you’ll need new selling strategies to break through to the next level.
Whether your next move involves launching a new product or entering an entirely new market, it’s important to know why and how you’ll execute your strategy. With the right plan and the right resources to bring it to life, you’ll have everything you need to keep winning on Amazon and beyond.

Here’s the most effective Amazon search tips, hacks, and schemes you can use to increase your Amazon seller ranking for [new products](https://startupbros.com/amazon-product-research/) quickly…
![Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Winning-the-buy-box-blog-header.png)
## **Amazon Traffic Hack #1 – Winning the Buy Box**
Truthfully, the biggest *tip for selling on Amazon* that you need to know is how to win the Buy Box. so this is a crucial part of [successfully selling on Amazon](https://startupbros.com/how-to-sell-on-amazon-fba/), especially if you’re not [creating and manufacturing your own products](https://startupbros.com/private-label-manufacturers/).
Here’s an example of what it means:
![Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Win-Amazon-Buy-Box-1024x581.jpg)
Look, of the 20 sellers for this product, only 4 of them are shown on the product page. You can bet that these four sellers are getting most of the sales for this listing…
If you’re one of the 16 losers for this product, what could you do to win the Buy Box?
### **Important Buy Box Metrics**
First, let’s take some time to review known Buy Box metrics. They can basically be grouped into three categories. For reference, you can see the first page of sellers for the kettlebell listing above, shown to your right.
#### **Pricing**
Understand, this is without a doubt the most important Buy Box metric.
So even though the image of the product listing above says that there are other offers “from $15.65”, closer inspection of the listings reveals that those cheaper options are actually more expensive once you take shipping into account.
![Amazon-Price-Page-Listings](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Price-Page-Listings](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Price-Page-Listings.png)
By default, Amazon lists products on this page in order of Price + Shipping, and that carries into the Buy Box unless one of the other metrics are way out of whack.
#### **Shipping Performance**
Normally, Amazon puts an enormous priority on fast, hassle-free shipping for their customers. That’s why they encourage sellers to use their Fulfilled by Amazon program.
And, shipping performance includes a number of individual metrics, including Order Defect Rate (ODR) and Perfect Order Percentage (POP), both of which we talked about in our [last post on Amazon ranking factors](https://startupbros.com/rank-amazon/).
* **ODR** (Order Defect Rate) is how many orders are canceled, returned, shipped improperly or get negative feedback for any reason.
* **POP** (Perfect Order Percentage) is how many orders go perfectly smoothly without any customer intervention.
Therefore, Amazon keeps track of [how often you run out of stock](https://startupbros.com/amazon-inventory-management/), so try to maintain a 100% in-stock rate.
#### **Seller Rating**
It seems to me that the magic number for the seller rating is 90%.
Now the listings shown to your right are a great example. Every seller on the first page has a 90% rating or above. However, you can see that a seller with a 90% rating has a higher Amazon seller ranking than a 100% rating.
It seems that as long as you hit 90% positive feedback, anything extra won’t have a huge impact on the Buy Box. Giving the most accurate and informative [product descriptions](https://startupbros.com/amazon-product-descriptions/) is the best way to have a happy customer. If your product is not exactly or better as described then the customer won’t be happy and unhappy customers tank your ratings.
Conversely, it’s uncommon for a seller with a <90% rating to have the Buy Box.
## **How to Win the Buy Box**
What are the specific steps? Turns out, there are only three:
**1. Make sure you’re eligible** – Your product must have the same ASIN as the listing you want to be featured on (more on this below). You also must meet all the criteria listed above.
**2. Lower your price** – If you’re eligible, pricing is pretty much the sole determining factor. All you have to do is find out what your competitors are selling your product for, and offer to sell and ship it for one cent less. Voila, you rank higher in the Buy Box.
![Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lower-Price-To-Win-Amazon-Buy-Box.jpg)
**3. Use** **Fulfilled By Amazon** – You’ll get a special orange Fulfillment By Amazon icon (see above) on your seller listing when you use FBA. You’ll also be able to compete on Amazon Prime listings, which is reason enough to join by itself. Plus, Amazon is constantly trying to push sellers onto FBA, so the sooner you hop on the bandwagon, the more rewards you’ll reap.
(NOTE – While lowering the price is certainly a good strategy to rank higher, it is not always a good long-term business strategy. You do NOT want to compete on price alone, as this will only start a price war/race to the bottom)
One of the top sellers you see in the list above is [*WayFair*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/node/index.html/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&merchant=&node=2351444011&tag=httpwwwsparke-20&linkId=53HLPS244W4JYBOJ). As I was poking around Amazon, I noticed them showing up a ton in our searches. They have over 200,000 reviews and this seller clearly knows what they’re doing… Just about every item in their shop is winning its Buy Box. Getting [Amazon reviews](https://startupbros.com/amazon-reviews-increased-sales/) has to become systematic to generate sales.
You can see another of their Buy Box-winning products below, shown here from inside their Seller profile shop:
![WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WayFair-Amazon-Seller-Shop.png)
![ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ASIN-Piggybacking-Blog-Header.png)
## **Amazon Traffic Hack #2 – ASIN Piggybacking**
If you know the Buy Box hack, your earning potential on Amazon instantly skyrockets. One of the most powerful Amazon tricks you can use is Amazon ASIN piggybacking.
Look:
### How to Find Your Amazon ASIN Number
There are 3 different methods to find your Amazon ASIN number: web address, listing details, or you can use a software tool for ASIN lookups.
We think the fastest way to find the Amazon ASIN is to use your browsers address bar when you find the product you’re looking to sell.
The [Amazon ASIN](https://www.nchannel.com/blog/amazon-asin-what-is-an-asin-number/) will be after the “dp/”.
![asin-browser-amazon](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin-browser-amazon](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/asin-broswer.png)
The next place to find the Amazon ASIN is in the details section of any product listing, near the bottom of the Amazon listing.
![asin-product-page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin-product-page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/asin-product-page.png)
**Now:**
**Steps to Amazon ASIN Piggybacking:**
![asin piggybacking](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![asin piggybacking](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-ASIN-Piggy-Backing.png)
1. Identify a successful non-unique product and find its ASIN. The Amazon **ASIN is listed in the Product Details section** of the product listing. (shown below)
2. [Research the manufacturer](https://startupbros.com/buying-from-alibaba/) to figure out how you can start reselling the product for yourself. Find out how much it will cost wholesale, and calculate what it will cost you to ship. **Is there room between that number and $0.01 less than the current Buy Box-winning price for you to make a profit?**
3. ***If the answer to and #2 is YES,*** contact the manufacturer and start selling. You’ve just found a gold nugget!
4. ***If the answer to #2 is NO,*** you may still be able to work out a special deal with the manufacturer if you ask for it. However, if you don’t think it’s worth it, look around for other products in the same niche… Chances are, there’s money to be made on a slightly lower ranked product.
**Blackhat Amazon ASIN Piggybacking**
As you can probably guess, some sellers have developed a blackhat form of ASIN piggybacking. Basically, it involves finding knockoffs of popular products and listing them with the same ASIN as their non-knockoff counterparts.
This works because the process Amazon uses to identify and suspend misleading sellers is extremely cumbersome. The seller whose listing is being illegitimately piggybacked has to [report the seller](https://startupbros.com/report-seller-on-amazon/) and order one of the suspected counterfeit seller’s products to prove that it is indeed a different product.
It should be noted here that **Amazon doesn’t have anything against selling cheap knockoffs.** They just don’t like it when you lie about what it really is or who really made it. So, I’m not telling you this method because I condone it, but merely to keep you informed doesn’t Amazon seller. Someday it could happen to you! Know how to protect yourself from having your product listing hijacked.
In order to keep your Amazon ASIN piggybacking above the table, make sure that you’re shipping the exact same product – **with the same brand, SKU and manufacturing code** – as the listing you’re trying to piggyback. You can’t even use [your own UPC code](https://startupbros.com/upc-codes-amazon-fba/). You have to list the product with the sellers ASIN.
## **Amazon Traffic Hack #3 – Custom URL Queries**
![Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Custom-URL-Queries-Blog-HEader.png)
The other really common tips for selling on Amazon that we had after our last post was for more information on how Amazon uses URL queries for search results and what you can do to take advantage of that.
So to show you what’s going on behind the scenes when you use Amazon, let’s start by looking at the URL for a search term you might want to **increase your amazon seller ranking** for. Therefore, when I search for “stove top espresso makers” from Amazon’s home page, here’s the URL that we get, shown in the image below:
![Amazon-URL-Query-Hack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-URL-Query-Hack](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-URL-Query-Hack.png)
In case you can’t see, this is the URL:
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb\_sb\_noss\_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker
If we dissect this URL, it’s easy to see that the **&field-keywords=** string is what Amazon uses to ID which search results to show. The ***/s/?url=search-alias*** is how Amazon tells itself to query a search results page, automatically sorted by best-sellers.
So, if we’re building links or promoting this page, we could strip the URL down to this:
http://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias&field-keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker
**Quick Note:** For some reason, removing the ?url=search-alias returns a different set of search results… Not sure why, but either way make sure you keep that in if you want to make it look like someone searched for that keyword from Amazon.
Now, let’s see what happens when we click on a product from the search page:
![Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-URL-Query-Search-Hack.jpg)
**http://www.amazon.com/Primula-Aluminum-Stovetop-Espresso-Coffee/dp/B001J1L59E/**ref=sr\_1\_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1422041743&sr=8-2&keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker
The part of the URL that’s bold is all that you need to bring up this product page in your browser. Everything else is there to tell Amazon how the viewer arrived at the listing.
You can see the **&keywords=stove+top+espresso+maker** tells Amazon that I arrived at the listing by searching for “stove top espresso maker”.
There are a couple other keyword strings to be aware of. You may have to do some experimenting one your own to figure out specific URL string combinations that delivers the page you want to see, but knowing these queries will give you a great starting point:
**&node=** is what Amazon uses for categories. If you click on “All Departments” and enter the Kitchen & Dining category, you’ll get this URL:
http://www.amazon.com/kitchen-dining/b/ref=sd\_allcat\_ki?ie=UTF8&node=284507
Just like with the *&field-keywords=* string, the only part of the URL necessary to tell Amazon to bring us to the “Kitchen & Dining” category is the *&node=* query, in this case **&node=284507**. So, if we wanted to link to this page, you could strip down the URL to this:
http://www.amazon.com/s/&node=284507
**&field-brandtextbin=** is another URL string you’ll want to be familiar with. It’s what tells Amazon to filter your search by a brand name. Since many customers already know what brand they want, you may be able to use this query for tracking and [SEO purposes](https://startupbros.com/amazon-seo/).
To bring everything we’ve learned about custom URL queries together, let’s say we wanted to bring up the search results page for the term **“espresso maker”** in the **Kitchen & Dining category**, filtered by the **Breville brand**. Here’s what the URL would look like:
http://www.amazon.com/s/&field-keywords=espresso&20maker&node=284507&field-brandtextbin=breville
One important thing to note here the use of the *&20* character instead of the *+* character in the URL. This tells Amazon to separate your keywords with spaces instead of actual plus signs.
[The Best Way to Optimize Your Listings with the Right Keywords](https://startupbros.com/optimize-amazon-fba-keywords/)
### How to Use the Custom URL Queries Hack
You may remember that Amazon keeps track of which products people end up buying after searching for a given keyword. They then use that data to help them decide which products are most relevant to the original search term.
This means that you can drive traffic to a product page from [instagram](https://startupbros.com/how-to-make-money-on-instagram/), facebook, or google using a custom URL and make Amazon think all those people came from a search result for your target keyword or brand. That way, every sale you make from that link counts toward that specific search term’s relevancy!
Make sense? No? Don’t worry, here’s a real-life example:
Let’s say you want to make this product rank higher for the “best espresso maker” keyword in the “Breville” brand:
![Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ranking-Your-Amazon-Product-With-URL-Search-Query-Hacks.jpg)
You could theoretically make Amazon think that every visitor to this page came from the search page for “best espresso maker”, filtered to the Breville brand, by directing traffic to this URL:
Now, every purchase a visitor makes through that link would count as coming from our target search term, “best espresso maker”.
Keep in mind, this isn’t 100% proven to work, but everything we know about Amazon’s ranking algorithm tells us it should. Plus, the absolute worst-case scenario is that you’re driving extra sales to one of your products… Amazon isn’t like Google where they’ll punish you for trying to optimize for their search engine.
###### Quick way to use the Custom URL Amazon Traffic Hack
By the way, if you’ve got lots of capital, you can fast-track this process yourself:
1. Search for a term you want to rank a product for
2. Click on your product
3. Buy it
4. Change your IP (make sure to clear your cache) or get on a different computer.
5. Repeat!
Of course, if you had that much capital – it may be better to spend them on Amazon Product Ads 🙂
![Vendor-Powered-Coupons-Blog-Header](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Vendor-Powered-Coupons-Blog-Header](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vendor-Powered-Coupons-Blog-Header.png)
## **Amazon Traffic Hack #4 – Vendor Powered Coupons**
If you’re an Individual Seller with a Pro Merchant account, a Professional Seller or a Vendor, then you can use Amazon’s built-in promotion tools. The savviest of shoppers always make use of Amazon’s daily deals.
You can access these deals for yourself by clicking on the today’s deals link in the top-most navigation menu next to the Amazon logo (underlined in green below). That link will take you to a page like this:
![Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Daily-Deals-Page.png)
As you can see, this section of Amazon’s website is almost a department unto itself. Promotions are given their own unique links and listing pages. The part I’d like to draw your attention to is the Coupons link, highlighted in the blue box above. This page takes you to a list of Amazon’s most popular Vendor Powered Coupons (VPC) in a variety of categories. See the page for yourself below:
![Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Vendor-Powered-Coupons-1024x865.jpg)
Scrolling down the page, we see coupons for Outdoor Gear & Clothing, Grocery & Gourmet, Baby, Household Supplies, Electronics, Personal Care Appliances, Kitchen, Industrial & Scientific, and Other Coupons. There are coupons categories for just about *everything* except for digital content!
Here’s what a coupon page looks like:
![Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Individual-Coupon-Page-1024x477.jpg)
(Note: you won’t see this page if you’re signed into Amazon; instead the coupon will automatically be added to your cart)
And depending on your seller status, you can create your own VPCs for [any products you sell](https://startupbros.com/what-to-sell-on-amazon/).
#### Tricks to Selling on Amazon Using Vendor Powered Coupons
Here are four straightforward ways to make the most of your VPC promotions:
1. **Promote VPCs just like you’d promote any other Amazon product listing.** Coupon pages have their own independent sales rank. So, if you’re a new seller or trying to compete in a tough niche, you may be able to get more eyes on your product by promoting a coupon for it instead of the listing itself.
2. **Create a bigger discount or coupon than your competition.**  Since Amazon tries to give customers the best possible deal, you only need to offer a *little bit* better of a coupon than your competition to maximize your chances of getting showcased on the Coupons page.
3. **Promote your VPCs on third-party deals sites.** This is a really sweet hack that can get you decent levels of traffic with very little effort. Simply [search Google for “submit a deal”](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22submit+a+deal%22) and you’ll get a list of 500,000+ websites that all want to showcase your deals. Submit your coupons to 10 of these sites per day because not all of them will take online coupons. And *if your deal is eye-catching enough,* you should start seeing some steady traffic flowing in.
4. **Give your VPCs out to friends and family in exchange for reviews/sales metrics.** This is also an awesome hack, which most of our clients use with great success. You can set up a VPC and discount your product down to your total costs (so you’re not taking a loss on each sale, but breaking even). Then give this VPC out to friends and family, and have them buy it through Amazon on their own. Most people will be ecstatic to receive such a deeply discounted product, and you’ll get a ‘Verified Purchase’ review – as well as a boost in your initial sales data!
**Important** – For #3 to work you really need to offer a standout deal. The penny-pinching you can get away with on Amazon probably won’t be enough to get you featured on the most popular Daily Deals sites.
So not everybody can make use of these coupons or Amazon’s other built-in promotion tools. However, if you have the right type of account, be sure to check them out!

## **Amazon Traffic Hack #5 – Automated Tools for Amazon Sellers**
Finally, no discussion of Amazon Traffic hacks would be complete without talking about the most important part of scaling *any*  [/ecommerce-workshop”> /ecommerce-workshop”>e-Commerce business](https://startupbros.com/get/training/)…
**Automation!**
As you continue reading, we’re quickly going to look at three of the most powerful ways you can automate selling on Amazon.
(check out this overview of the [best Amazon Seller Tools](https://www.smart-minded.com/en/business/amazon-fba-tools/) for automating your sales on Amazon)
**Please note!** This is *not* one of those posts where we’re secretly trying to get you to buy a bunch of stuff. We’ve found free alternatives where possible, and there are **no affiliate links** anywhere in this guide.
1. **Keyword Research**
One of the most common questions we hear from entrepreneurs transitioning from SEO for Google to selling on Amazon is, *“How do I find good keywords?”*
Well, the short answer is that there is no built-in [keyword tool for Amazon](https://startupbros.com/amazon-keyword-research-tools/). (But we cover 19 tools you can use there).
##### Amazon Keyword Search Tips
However, you can manually perform keyword research for Amazon.
* **Identify a popular root keyword** in Google’s Keyword Planner
* **Enter that keyword into Amazon’s search bar** followed by a random letter (a to z)
* **Get Search Suggestions** for that keyword.
You can see this process in action below:
![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-1](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-1](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-1.png)
![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amazon-Search-Auto-Complete-2.png)
It won’t take long for you to realize that manually finding and recording the Search Suggestions for even one root keyword would quickly turn into a huge task.
What if you had a tool that automated this whole process for you?
### Recommended Amazon Keyword Search Tools
* **Tool #1:** 100% free tool that does exactly that – it’s the [KTD Amazon Keyword Tool](http://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/amazon-keyword-tool/). When you enter a keyword, it automatically queries Amazon’s search box for all the long-tail Search Suggestions for your keyword + each letter of the alphabet.
* **Tool #2:** A premium alternative, we’ve heard good things about [MerchantWords](https://www.merchantwords.com/) (not an affiliate link).  They typically use a system that pulls data from major search engines, identifies matching queries in Amazon, and then use an algorithm to combine that data and give you estimated traffic numbers. Still may be worth checking out for some.
2. **Product Re-Pricing**
Using the Buy Box Hack a few times, you’ll start running into a problem… Your competitors are using the exact same tactics on you that you’re using on them. They’ll undercut you by a small amount to get placed above you in the Buy Box for your products.
What can you do about it?
### Recommended Product Re-price Tool
Easy – invest in a tool that automatically reprices your products so that you always stay on top of the Buy Box. This is almost a requirement when you have lots of products for sale; there’s just no way to stay on top of pricing for *all* of them.
**Tool #1:**  The best one we’ve found is [Sellery](http://sellerengine.com/sellery/) because it’s a straightforward application that gives you control over when and by how much you reprice your products. Here’s a screenshot of the interface:
![Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview](https://startupbros.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sellery-Amazon-Repricer-User-Interface-Preview.png)
**Tool #2:** An alternative to Sellery is [RepricerExpress](http://www.repricerexpress.com/). It does pretty much everything Sellery does with a similarly easy-to-use interface. The perks are that it’s a flat monthly rate instead of commission-based, and it claims to be one of the fastest large-volume repricers on the market.
(**NOTE** – Be careful when using Repricing Tools, and be sure to keep a close eye on all your product prices and repricing errors are not unheard of, and they can be devastating.)
3. **Listing, Inventory & Shipping Management**
Finally, large volume sellers and vendors, especially those who sell their inventory across multiple platforms, will inevitably need a tool to manage inventory and shipping.
### Recommended Amazon Inventory Management Tools
* **Tool #1:** If you’re an Amazon-only seller, the best tool we can recommend is [InventoryLab](https://startupbros.com/get/inventorylab/) because it’s an all-in-one inventory management system. You can create product listings, keep track of shipments and inventory, manage income and expenses, and analyze your business’s growth and performance over time.
* **Tool #2:** Now, if you are selling on Amazon *AND* an eBay (or a NewEgg seller, or one of the other six supported platforms), we recommend [SellBrite](http://www.sellbrite.com/). It sacrifices the accounting, financial and analytics tools of InventoryLab in favor of multi-channel inventory and listing management tools.
For example, SellBrite automatically keeps inventory for your Amazon store, eBay store and Etsy store all synced up so that you’re never showing duplicate products. You can also manage multiple stores on the same channel (if you have two Amazon accounts, for example). You can learn more about specific features on their website.

## Wrapping This Up…
So, selling on Amazon doesn’t have to be intimidating, even if you’re a new seller. It’s the largest e-commerce platform in the world, and now you have all the tools you need to make the most of it. But in the end, nothing beats getting your hands dirty and actually putting these Amazon ranking hacks to work!
So what are you waiting for? Finally, get out there [buy UPC codes](https://startupbros.com/upc-codes-amazon-fba/) and list your first product! [Start with Retail Arbitrage](https://startupbros.com/retail-arbitrage-amazon/) if you’re looking for a smaller investment. But take action anyway!
**TL;DR (Amazon Selling Tips)**
* Use the Buy Box Hack by making sure your offer is eligible, accurate, and priced a penny lower than the competition.
* Get easy sales by piggybacking on the Amazon ASINs of successful products.
* Drive traffic to your product pages using custom URL queries to “trick” Amazon into ranking your products for high-volume search terms.
* Create Vendor Powered Coupons if you’re competing in a tough niche because they’ll have their own independent Sales Rank.
* Automation is the ultimate secret to seller growth – identify which tools will help you make the most sales.
Therefore if you have any other Amazon tricks, search tips, or seller ranking hacks, I’d love to hear about them in the comments below! See you there 🙂

   Really great job if your aim was to teach the world how to race to the bottom on price so that nobody actually makes any profit (including ultimately, you).
   I know you call out that this \*might\* be a bad idea, but then the whole of the rest of the artice is about how to undercut on price to WIN the Buy Box. Instead the suitable, and not to mention responsible, approach is to MATCH the buy box price and then get an equal share of the sales by rotating through.

     So why is this wrong, yes it might end up with no one making a profit but isn’t this the tactic WalMart, Kmart and many of the brick & mortar use to undercut the competition and bring the business to their store? Why is Amazon any different?

       Because amazon has engineered the shopping experience to make you completely anonymous as a seller on the platform. The stores mentioned gain value from returning customers who might buy more profitable items next time or alongside. This effect doesn’t happen on amazon. You lower by 1 cent, they lower by 1 cent, repeat until both parties are giving the product away at cost. Chris is 100% correct, better to share sales and make $4.00 on 50% of the sales volume than race to the bottom and still end up sharing. If you don’t have an actual and substantial wholesale cost advantage (which almost never exists), lowering the price is a bad idea.

         This is the nature of arbitrage, it tends to zero. There’s no reason easy profit should continue to exist for resellers.

           Hey Erik, thank you for checking out the article and reaching out. To directly answer your question, no it’s not necessary. It’s an extra space to separate the keywords and make sure the keywords were spaced out and read separately by Amazon. It might have not done anything but we know in this particular situation it worked.

   This is probably a silly question but is there any Daily Estimated Sales online tool in real-time so we can identify sales rank of products we wanna sell and perhaps calculate if selling such products can make us profit > 15% ? Ex. Let’s say we find FIFA2018 DVD sold @ Walmart for 5$. Using such a tool we can enter the same product name and get results it is sold 15 copies today on Amazon between 15 & 25$.

    Hi
    Surely if you want to purchase your own product then you would need a separate Amazon account with a separate credit card each time otherwise Amazon would just know its you buying your own products?

    2 of my listings (in small category) were hi-jacked by an experienced seller (who has over 10,000 seller’s feedback) last week.
    1. Hi-jacker’s products have different UPC no.
    2. Hi-jacker’s products have different brand name.
    I only put my brand logo sticker onto product packaging.
    My brand (trade mark) is still pending status.
    I tried to match the price, hi-jacker still won the buy box, even though I am FBA while hi-jacker is FBM.
    Now, the price is so low that I even cannot pay for FBA fee.
    All my inventory in FBA is stud. I lost all the buy box once they hi-jacked.
    I removed all photos, description, search term etc. with success.
    But now, I lost the control of my listing. Whatever I did, there is no impact on the listing.
    May be the listing is killed.
    I sent out the message to hi-jacker, no response. Sent the complaint – report listing abuse, violation, no response from Amazon.
    I asked friend to help buying from hi-jacker.
    Looks like I am totally stud. Amazon seller support suggests me to remove all FBA inventory to protect interest. I was told even I tried to set up Amazon giveaway, it will all goes to Hi-jacker. But I thought FBM cannot do giveaway.
    Any suggestion?
    Thanks

    Comment on Hack #3
    By the way, if you’ve got lots of capital, you can fast-track this process yourself:
    1. Search for a term you want to rank a product for
    2. Click on your product
    3. Buy it
    4. Change your IP (make sure to clear your cache) or get on a different computer.
    5. Repeat!
    In testing fba and other aspects of ordering and delivering my listings, I occasionally purchase my own products. Among other things, it allows me to review all of the screens buyers would see through the check out process.
    To conserve capital, I created a promotion of 95% discount. I am the only one who knows and can use the code. I end up receiving my items back at the cost of delivery plus a much reduced Amazon fee.
    Lots of uses for creating sales by buying your own product back if mindful of ip address and delivery address.

    I was wondering if you ever considered changing the structure of your website?
    Its very well written; I love what youve got to say. But maybe you could a little more in the way of content so people could connect with it better.
    Youve got an awful lot of text for only having one or two pictures.
    Maybe you could space it out better?

    It doesn’t matter in places you understand it from – newspapers, other websites and news sources,
    whatever. However, every time a blogger does enjoy what he writes about, he’ll probably stick to
    it for a long time. In internet affiliate marketing,
    website visitors to a particular website is driven from
    another website or from email.

    It is very hard to sell your products on the Amazon, specially on the initial stage. I searched for so many ways about how we can start selling on the amazon. Winning the buy box is actually a great idea and I will try this trick for sure. Apart from that getting positive reviews is one of the most important factor to fight with competitors.
    If I do blogging about my product and give amazon link their, will it improve my product listing?

    Hi.
    I just wanted to know, if you were to repeatedly buy your own product to boost sales wouldn’t amazon flag that as fraudulent activity? I’ve heard amazons algorithm is capable of recognising these unnatural sales. Also if that is the case how does amazon recognise this?

    I just came back to this post having read it more than a year ago. And actually ever is as relevant as it was then, the only issue is getting around to doing it all. But if you do it works – its all about getting the basics right on Amazon and then the dirty hacks after that, which give you the ‘ninja results’ but you have to have the basics right first unfortunately! My experience anyway… Thanks again for the great article!

    Hi there
    I have a question with regards to selling on amazon and cannot seem to find the answer anywhere!
    My question is –
    Can I sell two separate products from two different suppliers under one listing with amazon FBA? (just for this purpose I will use a coffee mug and a spoon for example).
    More to the point can I have two separate products sent to amazon FBA separately and list them under one listing? And when someone purchases the listing, amazon FBA with send both products in the same box to the customer?
    Would this be correct or am I completely wrong?
    I understand I will have to list the item under ‘bundle’ possibly. Basically I need to know if I can send two separate products to amazon FBA and they will send them both out to the customer as I would like to list them under one listing as a bundle but the products wont arrive at amazon FBA together as they are not from the same supplier.

      No, amazon will not combine products for you. You need to have the two products delivered to your office/warehouse, package them as a pair in one package youself, barcode the package, and send that to amazon.

    You dont need this extension. Obviously it only works on Chrome and people use other browsers. Just add the item to your cart. Click “Cart”, then +10. Input 999. It will show you the amount that is in stock if it’s under 1000 units.

    Amazon has not been posting all the reviews people have written, even though we know the reviews were very good, met all the criteria,etc. Amazon sends them a confirmation that their review will be posted, posts it for a day or two and then it disappears. We’ve had that happen about 10 times and we can’t build our reviews. Any thoughts? Amazon has no answer for us as to why this happens.

      This happened to me too!!! With no answers at all from them. They wanted me to provide the lost feedback and who the seller name was. Of course I didn’t keep a copy of every review. My guess is that they somehow linked it to an item purchased by a friend or family member or had a coupon. All of which were valid purchases… so annoying!

    Great tips! I have been noticing that sometimes a used version of an item, priced higher than new versions will “win the buy box.” Is this because Amazon is doing the fulfillment – although, none of these items are Prime eligible. or what’s happening there?

    Hey Will, nice one. Just wondering. First, is there a way to run a report on sales volume against UPC. For example, I don’t know what I am buying and I don’t want to purchase “cat in the bag” from the wholesaler not knowing if item will eventually sell or not. Is there a tool that will help you to see what’s the sales volume per product UPC on Amazon.
    Also, having multiple accounts on Amazon, all with reputation, I know its against the rules bla bla, but in reality, is this an advantage and higher chances to sell?

    My question is about the book sellers who are posting 50-100,000+ reviews a year. Since only a % of buyers will make a review, the actual sales could be 5x or more than the number of reviews. Amazon won’t respond to questions about this, but this strongly suggests that there is someway that sellers are spewing out clouds of reviews, positive in all cases. Further, now that Amazon only lists about 5 reviews per page, and does not make searching and filtering possible, then it is easy to bury a negative review.

    Hello,
    I found your article fantastic! I was wondering if you knew of or had any recommendations for any software/website services that allow you to do basically the same thing as your spread sheet with the addition of matching my product identifiers (SKU, UPC, etc.) with Amazon ASINs and pulling not only the fees but Amazon’s “Commission” on that ASIN/listing?
    Basically what I’m looking for is something where I can retrieve Amazon ASIN numbers and other data in bulk fashion by searching with one of the following identifier types: UPC, EAN, SKU, MPN, ISBN, or Keywords. Gathering FBA fulfillment information including the “Comission”, FBA tier level, order handing cost, pick & pack cost, and weight handling cost.
    I know this may just be a pipe dream but I know there are services out there that allow you to search for an Amazon product based off of the identifier (SKU) and pull all the fees including commission such as Inventory Lab’s “Scout” feature. Unfortunately their service limits the search to a manual one at a time search which is extremely tedious. It would make sense that if they can pull the data, and have access to all the information that someone would have created a service that could do that in a bulk fashion!
    Anyway I would greatly appreciate your input and suggestions!

    As an Amazon Seller, it is also important that you know your competitor products’ quantities in stock. I found a new interesting tool which is a Google Chrome Extension called Amzpecty. This incredibly inspects all product offers quantities in just seconds. Just search “Amzpecty” in google chrome’s app store and instantly add it to your Google chrome browser.

    Hey Guys, This is helpful and the article a few ideas I will test. We just left a paid Amazon forum because of too much black hat techniques. Also, if you rely on Amazon as your primary income (as my wife and I have for the past 9 years) trying these things very softly.
    We sell stationery, our own products, so a lot of the buy box does not relate to us.
    But I’d love to hear if anyone has had our issue: Amazon starting LLC’s in their category and basically killing our business. Yep, they basically saw our margin was their opportunity (As Jeff Bezos said many times) and they took it to hear. We were a $15K/mo seller now less than $500. And we’ve tried talking to others and NO ONE can tell us what the hell has happened. We tried Amazon Ads, Google, Facebook, etc. The only thing that we came up with is Amazon no longer buys Google PPC. That helped us a lot. But after we paid a programmer to find out how much they were spending, insane amounts, $93,102 per month on our category listings alone. Is it true, we got the data but how accurate, never know I guess.
    Look at this point if you are a $10,000 per month seller we would like to hear from you or even potentially hire you for a consultation.
    I do not know how anyone selling a product that everyone else is and competing on price, FBA fees (btw-they’ve tripled in the past year) can make margin and support a family is beyond me. I guess we are doing something wrong.
    We believe someone hijacked our listings and that hurt. But our sales haven’t gone back up. Amazon is NO help. I guess we are both seeing some end to this business and wish we didn’t have to.
    Thanks for any advice.

    Hi Will,
    I’m an indie author, and I published several kindle books. I do it for almost 2 years and I couldn’t understand yet how the SEO of the kindle books works. I got amazing (!) verified reviews (from reviewers I send my ebooks to for free) but I don’t see any purchases. I researched the subject for over two years and I got many bad tips from the net (or maybe I used them wrong :/). In addition, I just tried the Merchantwords (free version) and when I got a term in kindle with 2,400 results the first books that appears have a low sales ranking, while a term with less than 100 searches in the kindle section showed in the first page results books that selles well.
    What am I doing wrong????
    Can you give some (usefull) tips for kindle authors?
    P.S. I Apologize for any gramatical mistakes, English is not my native tounge (My books are translated, but I does the marketing completely by myself).

    Hi
    Enjoying reading all of these great tips. However I too have no luck with the buy box. Been selling successfully for 4 years. Excellent metrics in all areas 450+ feedbacks 99% rating, lowest price etc etc. It seems to me that the only criteria for the buy box is being FBA. I send out myself and therefore no buy box.
    Also I don’t get this ASIN piggybacking. Surely that’s a given. You find a successful product and if you have or can source the same item and make money on it then you list it along with other sellers of the item and it is automatically the same ASIN. In fact Amazon doesn’t like it if you try and create a new catalogue entry for an existing product. Why mention ASIN’s therefore ?

    I am also a Seller on Amazon, I have found a way that helps me with new product launches. I have did some research and discovered “Review Groups” with bloggers and I have been doing this for over a year now and I have to say my raiting went up. I can control where they look, what they look out, how much they pay and get a sweet review out of the deal. I find reviews, Key words and Seller raitings are #1 factors when it comes to buying from Amazon.

    Hey Will great post! I am still a little confused with Hack#2 Blackhat Piggybacking. I have a question regarding piggybacking. I found products that have a brand name on them selling on Amazon but it’s not a registered trademark or anything. I also found the exact same product from the same manufacturer but it doesn’t have a brand name on it. It’s just black. My question is can I still piggyback off of the brand name product I saw on Amazon with my exact same product that I found that doesn’t include the name? Thanks for your help

    I have heard that SuperURLs are now no longer working (Amazon has figured it out and blocked). So, if you’re in a super competitive category and you can’t just ask people to click though the pages manually until they find your product and then buy to help you rank (because you can’t find the ranking position of your product or it’s on a super high page, for example) – what can you do to get ranked by generating sales against your main keyword?

    I have purchased several things off of Amazon in the past and I disagree that the fulfillment center is fast. The only thing they are fast about is throwing your 5 items in a box, breaking 4 of them and smashing the 5th item.
    Also I find that the quality of the item is much higher when purchasing from a private seller. Example when I buy through the fulfillment center, I think I am buying a loaf of brand A breads, only to receive my bread and find out it is an old moldy generic brand of garbage.
    To me it seems that Amazon does not care about the buyer or the seller, since they want to push the most expensive item on you so they get the most profit. Example I you search for a banana, then go to the department they are in so you can search from low price to high price to highest price, more than likely you will find a few pages of the most expensive ones like for 4 bucks along with a few toys, electronics and junk in between, but then when you get to page 208, almost the end of the listing, you will find the perfect one for a penny?
    I my opinion Amazon has the worse search engine out there and I think people should be informed about their shady sales tactics, or just shop somewhere else. Like I said, I use to purchase a lot on Amazon but it has been 3 years now and I refuse to ever buy another item from there again.

    Is it better to the highest ranking product or the highest ranking product without inventory or very little inventory?

    Hey Guys,
    Wonderful blog post – I love your website. I must say I am one of your fans.
    Of course, I have a question about this post :
    Is there a way to find which keywords people are searching for on Amazon (like you can do in Google)? Or what are the keywords for a particular product? (e.g. hot pot instead of boiling pot). Do you just put those words in the title, description and that would take care of it?
    Thanks 🙂

    Great article but it applies to sellers who have their own product (or they have rights to edit the product listing). What about the smaller sellers who rely on arbitrage (buying products online/locally ‘low’ to sell high)?

    Great article. I have a question about the suggestion you make at the end of Hack 3, where you say you could do this yourself, but it basicly would be very expensive. Are you suggesting you do this for your own Private Label products, to drive your rankings up, or for your own listing for a branded product, so that your particular listing for the branded product ranks high?In either case, you would still have the product, so you could relabel it and send it back into Amazon FBA, so the cost of doing it would be the seller fee and the other amazon fees, right? Am I thinking about this correctly?

      While its good to rank higher for the keyword you would be better to offer a coupon or discount with the aim of also getting a good review. It may cost you a bit more but alot less work and can give them a jazzy URL for keywork and get the reviews.. I’ve heard feedback genius is meant to be good to streamline that area..any reviews??

    Vendor Powered Coupons (VPC) are only for Amazon to use…
    ex… Only for Amazon to use with products they buy directly from the vendors/suppliers…. As a product seller you do NOT have the option to use this strategy regardless of whether you ship personally or whether you use FBA.
    I’ve spoken with several people there…
    It could be used to grab & promote as an affiliate I guess, but that is chump change IMO compared to Private Labeling your own product.

    You have brought up a lot of good suggestions and I commend you on your investigative ability.
    I would like to caution sellers about just piggybacking on listings. We have had many clients over the years that have done this just to get into a bit of trouble. Yes it is nice to be able to find a listing that already has a ranking that is higher than others and just add yourself to that listing, but you have to make sure the listing is complete and has the correct information. Just last week we have had several clients that came to us asking for help in removing negative feedback from buyers complaining that they were not getting what they thought they should receive based on the listing. And they were right, the image showed one thing, and there was no information in the listing (title, bullet points or description) that stated otherwise. Therefore there was no recourse that could be taken on the part of the seller, and you know that Amazon’s primary focus is on making the buyer happy. Your feedback rating gets too bad, Amazon will take action.
    You had also discussed generic product listings for items that were not a name brand product. Once again this is more tricky than you make it sound. There are many Sellers out there that are working very hard to create their own brand; they have designers, work with manufacturers to make products for them and have spent the time and money to get their brand trademarked. They are not Nike or Black & Decker or Otterbox, but they are brands that are recognized by Amazon through the Brand Registry. Not that many people are familiar with the smaller brands and just seem to think it is fine to attach their generic product to these listings. These are companies that have put a lot of effort into developing a following on Amazon and other marketplaces, just for someone who got a deal on a generic product that looks similar to add themselves to the listing. This not only takes sales away from the Seller who is developing the brand, it has also hurt the brand itself. Comments and reviews from buyers that dislike the product or find the quality inferior negatively impact these brands, but the buyer didn’t get the brand item that they thought they were buying. Please have your readers make sure the listing is generic and not just a small brand. There are to many Sellers that are mistakenly adding products to listings that are actually brands (even though working with the trademark & copyright infringement group to have these generic products removed from our clients listings keeps us busy) that should be creating their own listings for those generic products and working to affect the ranking instead of taking advantage of the work another Seller has already done.

    Hi,
    Thanks for another great post! I have one newbie question to ask you…When you are going to put your listing on Amazon do you go to the existing product listing and click the “Have one to sell? Sell On Amazon” button? Or do you do something different? I’m not sure how to go about listing new imported products as I have only ever sold used textbooks which I piggyback onto existing listings in the used section.

     Thanks for the info. I did retail arbitrage prior to private labeling on Amazon and I found that it was really effective to price slightly higher than the competition. Even if you are a few cents higher but within 1% of your competition (depending on the category) you will share the buy box and possibly avoid triggering their repricer. This avoids the whole race to the bottom and still gets you sales.

             Does Amazon charges fees for purchases made using promotional codes?
             Imagine, I have a product with the listing price of $40. Amazon normally charges $7 per order. If I give out $40 promotional codes to my buyers, does Amazon still charge me for $7?

             From my experience you will be charged $1.00 or 15% (whichever is higher) as a commission from Amazon. The FBA fee’s would remain the same.
             Most of my products originally would cost $5-$10 – but i ended up paying $2-$5 when i gave out “heavy discounted promotional codes”

       Thanks Martin, glad you liked it! Unfortunately Amazon is really cracking down on using HTML in product descriptions. You can still get away with some basics elements (bold, italics, bullet list) – but Amazon is even starting to crack down there. I would get your description up ASAP – as Amazon has not yet taken down any existing HTML listings. They are just beginning to stop new ones…

     Advanced tactics here, thanks for sharing. I’ve been selling on Amazon successfully for 2 years now, and the first couple weeks of a new listing is always the worst. I will try to apply these on our next product launch – thank you for sharing!

       Thanks for bringing up that important point Rob.
       There are many other aspects of being a successful Amazon seller – but when speaking solely about ranking hacks, price cutting is obviously a big deal. You can instantly go from the bottom of the list to the top.
       I’ll be sure to add a disclaimer that this is solely for ranking your Amazon products well!

     So the main takeaway is that to win the buy box you need to be priced lower than the competition? Isn’t that a race to the bottom? I thought the idea from previous posts was to compete by selling better: branding products, writing better descriptions, etc

       Maybe I should have made that point #5 – I do not believe it’s the most important Uri! Advanced tactics like the URL Search Query hack and Vendor Powered Coupons are much more effective for new sellers.
       Furthermore, I would not recommend competing on price alone! However, if you’re playing a pure arbitrage game – you’re going to have to in most cases – at least until you can start differentiating your product and brand.
       Sorry for the confusion…

         These have not worked for me. I dont’ know what it is, but I struggle to win the buybox. I’ve lost out on the buybox to sellers with an 82% rating, and I have a 100% rating, and I was priced lower than them.

Are you an eCommerce seller wondering what to sell on Amazon and how to select products that maximise your business potential?
Then don’t worry, we have got you covered.
As businesses from diverse industries increase their presence on Amazon to reach customers directly, the platform is becoming a perfect place to sell products nationally as well as internationally.
In this article, we will look into popular product categories on Amazon, share effective strategies to sell them, and highlight common mistakes that new sellers should avoid.
## Factors to Consider for Selecting the Right Product Mix
For new sellers, it is important to know how to choose the right product category to build a profitable business. The right product can help boost customer engagement, empowering businesses to succeed in the [competitive e-commerce space](https://shipglobal.in/blogs/7-trends-in-e-commerce-for-cross-border-shipping-in-2024/).
It’s important to pay attention to various aspects of businesses when selecting what to sell on Amazon.
Some of these factors are:
* Profit Margins: Look into the different costs involved in selling products online.
  Select products that are easy to package and ship. Did you know that nearly 30% of profits can be eaten up by Amazon fees, shipping fees, and other possible expenses in certain niches?
  Further, choose products that are non-perishable. Products with longer life span can help minimise loss due to unforeseen circumstances.
* Quality: Choosing high-quality materials will make your products stand out from that of your competitors.
* High Demand Products: Conduct research to identify high-demand products. It is essential for you to know what is trending within the online marketplace.
* Seasonal Items: You can decide if you want to sell seasonal products and items that enjoy high demand during certain times of the year.
  Pro Tip: Make the most of the festive season to reach a wider audience.

## How to Understand Different Product Trends and Conduct Market Research
![Understand Different Product Trends and Conduct Market Research](https://shipglobal.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Understand-Different-Product-Trends-and-Conduct-Market-Research.webp)
Amazon is used across different countries worldwide and offers products to suit varied demands. Businesses can use online tools such as Jungle Scout and Helium 10 to look into competitive prices, market trends, and the best-selling products among different industries. 
Businesses can also look into product reviews and customer feedback to understand what they want and which are the top-selling items.
[Amazon search](https://www.amazon.com/?initialSessionID=143-4041911-8997327&ld=NSGoogle) is one of the free tools that you can use to analyse patterns in specific niches, spot popular and upcoming products, and explore new opportunities. It enables you to narrow down your search even within subcategories.
## Common Mistakes to Avoid
Here are some mistakes all new sellers on Amazon should avoid:
#### Do Not Sell Oversaturated Products
This can result in reduced-profit margins and lower demand for your products. Conduct a thorough research before venturing into any category.
#### Do Not Forget About Customer Service and Product Quality
Poor quality items can result in low customer service and reviews. Amazon sellers should ensure they focus on quality and their customer needs.
#### Do Not Forget About Shipping Costs
To become a reliable and successful Amazon seller, you should always ensure you look into shipping costs, seller fees, and if there are any unexpected costs.
![Some mistakes all new sellers on Amazon should avoid](https://shipglobal.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Common-Mistakes-to-Avoid-visual-selection.webp)

1. Look at Low-Risk Items: You can look into low-risk and low-cost items. This ensures that you understand the process of selling on Amazon before committing to larger products and investments.

But first, what is Amazon and why should you be using it anyway? That might sound like a silly question – everyone knows what Amazon is. But if you’re new to this business, there are probably some stats you’re unaware of. Let me point out a few of those facts just to give you an impression of how important the platform is:
![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Sell-on-Amazon-–-Inner-1.jpg)
* Last year, Amazon’s annual net revenue was a staggering [386 billion US dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266282/annual-net-revenue-of-amazoncom/). That’s right – *billion*! And that number is increasing at an incredible rate year after year.
* It’s not just Amazon as a company profiting; small- and medium-sized businesses located only in the United States sold on average [4,000 items per minute](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/amazon-statistics) in 2019. And that doesn’t even take into account businesses located elsewhere around the world or the amazing growth the platform has experienced over the past two years.
* People are recognizing the benefits of selling on Amazon by the hundreds of thousands. Just in the first quarter of 2021, around [283,000 thousand people](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/amazon-statistics) signed up to sell on the platform.
So, having pointed out a few facts and benefits of selling on Amazon, let’s begin with the guide.
## How to Sell on Amazon: Beginners’ Guide
![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Sell-on-Amazon-–-Inner-2.jpg)
### Step 1: Create a business plan
Starting out without a business plan is a bit like trying to walk home from the bar with a blindfold on. Sure, you might get there eventually, but you’re going to waste a lot of time and effort. And if you run into a problem it might cost you to fix it.
So, what do you need to do? First, you should find your niche, or what products you’re going to sell (we’ll look at this in the next step) – bearing in mind the competitive advantage. This leads on to market research (this will be covered in more detail in Step 3), which should be conducted with things like expenses, marketing, and the competition in mind.
Now that you’ve settled on a product and done your research, you should set a goal and then create a strategy laying out how you’re going to reach it. This goal should be realistic and it’s better to be cautious when starting off – you’ll be able to check your progress as you go and if you’re exceeding your expectations then you can alter your plan. The strategy should include how you’re going to market, whether you’re going to use other platforms, and so on. It should also include budgeting, and this should also be cautious. Bear in mind that you’re going to be spending money on merchandise before you can make your money back.
Having said this, make sure your business plan doesn’t turn into a 100-page monster: the best plans are short and compact. Remember that Brian Chesky, the founder of Airbnb, started out with only a one-page document.
### Step 2: Find your niche
This can be a really daunting step. You know you want to sell something, but *what*? Precisely what do I need to sell on Amazon? There are so many different products and product categories out there. Well, the answer ties into Step 3 because you can’t find your niche without a dash of market research. We have [a helpful article](https://sellbery.com/blog/ecommerce/best-selling-products-on-amazon.html) that serves as a great launching point: a summary of what’s currently selling best on Amazon. (It’s also worth noting that some categories are restricted unless you have a Professional Account; [check here before you start out](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200164330)).
But bear in mind that you might be able to make more profit exploring a less popular product category where customers are passionate and competition isn’t as high. You need to find what’s best for you – and then do some quick calculations to make sure it’s worth it. I’d recommend a projected profit margin of 20% or higher otherwise you’ll need to ship a lot of product for it to pay off.
### Step 3: Conduct market research
![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/market-research.gif)
Now that you have some idea of what your niche will be, it’s time to broaden the scope of your research. This is one area where the work you put in will really pay off – literally!
Let’s break it down into the key components:
* Product research (you already did this in Step 2)
* Customer research
* Overheads, suppliers, shipping options
* Competition research
Starting to sell without doing any customer research is probably a bit like marrying someone after a first date: you might get away with it, but chances are you’re not going to be the best match. So, what should you do?
Customer research is something that you should constantly be doing and a lot of it will be organic: once you’re selling, you’ll see which products get the most clicks and make the most sales. If you have an item that’s getting lots of eyeballs but few conversions, for example, you can consider offering a temporary discount and then tweaking the price if it’s successful.
But it’s a little bit more difficult when you’re starting off. Since you already have your niche, you can see which of your competitors’ products are doing well and which aren’t – and then try to work out why. You can also use tools like [Google’s Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) to see what kind of things your prospective customer base is searching for.
Next you should look for your suppliers and calculate shipping and other costs. It’s worth looking at multiple options here: cutting your overheads even by a little bit can make a big difference to your bottom line in the long run.
**💡 ALSO READ – [Amazon Dropshipping – A-Z Guide](https://sellbery.com/blog/amazon-dropshipping.html)**
Depending on how much stock you’re willing to buy, you might be able to qualify for wholesaling discounts. You can send emails to your prospective suppliers, try to negotiate, and see which is most competitive. And if you can’t afford a lot of stock, promise that you’ll buy a larger quantity if you meet certain targets – that might be enough to entice them into offering you a discount.
Finally, you should check out what your competitors are doing – especially what they’re selling similar products for. If you can afford to beat them on price that will drive many of their customers to you.
You should also think about signing up to Amazon FBA (Fulfilment by Amazon) – I’ll explain this in more detail in the advanced seller’s guide.
### Step 4: Register an Amazon account
This is probably the most obvious step. You’ll need things like a verifiable ID, tax statements and a phone number.
One important thing to note is the Amazon fees that they apply to all sales but which vary by product category. They tend to range [from 8% to 15%.](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees) Depending on how well your business is doing, it might be cheaper in the long run to consider [a selling plan.](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html)
### Step 5: Create a product listing
You have your Amazon account; now it’s time to add your products. Simply click on the Inventory drop-down menu on your homepage and click Add a Product and follow the steps. Pay special attention to sections like Product Name – this can be up to 250 characters, so include as much information as possible that your prospective customers are likely to search for. Also, don’t forget to add accurate but appealing images of what you’re selling.
### Step 6: Manage your inventory
This is basically keeping track of your stock, making sure you have enough stock to fulfil orders (which is very important if you’re selling on multiple platforms), and avoiding wastage. This is something you can manage yourself, and that’s probably the best option if you’re just starting out and are only selling on one platform. If you’re a little bigger you should consider FBA; and if you sell across multiple marketplaces you should seriously consider getting a [third-party Amazon integration](https://sellbery.com/how-it-works) that works on different platforms and tracks your stock across all of them.
### Step 7: Follow up on customer reviews
Customer reviews are a great way of conducting customer research. And prospective customers really care about them: [according to surveys,](https://www.junglescout.com/blog/online-review-statistics/) 4 in 5 Amazon customers are drawn to the products with the highest ratings and strongest reviews.
So what can you do to get those great reviews? Offer a solid product with good customer service and prompt delivery. And try sending personalized email requests for feedback shortly after your customers have received their orders.
## How to sell on Amazon – tips for advanced sellers
![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-Sell-on-Amazon-–-Inner-3.jpg)
That concludes our beginners’ guide; time to move on to the second part of our Amazon guide. Read on for some more advanced tips for the more experienced of the Amazon seller types; but even if you’re a beginner these might come in handy.
### Tip 1: Run Amazon product promotions and advertising
Amazon offers a lot of native options for promotion and advertising that you should definitely utilize if you want to drive sales. Even if you’re thinking your profit margin can’t afford it, it might prove more valuable in the long run: more money (albeit at a lower margin), more reviews, and more customers who might come back.
To set a promotion up, simply go to the Advertising section and click Promotions. There are options like promo codes, percentage codes, and Buy One Get One Free. You can apply these to certain groups of products only and add conditions that incentivize buyers to purchase more, like 10% off one unit but 15% off two.
As I mentioned earlier, it can be good research to offer discounts on underperforming products to see if sales pick up: it may just be that the price point is too high.
### Tip 2: Get more reviews
I already pointed out how important reviews are and offered a tip in the beginners’ section. But there are some more specialist techniques you can use.
Amazon offers an Early Reviewer Program for products that have fewer than 5 stars. To use, it costs at least $15 to set up plus a one-time payment of $60 on your first review through the program. Why? Because Amazon sends out review requests to your buyers in exchange for gift cards. The overhead is pretty steep but it can be worth it if it bumps your products up by a star or two – just be selective about which product you select because you don’t want to waste the money on a weaker item.
### Tip 3: Build an email list
This isn’t an easy task; it can be quite time- and labor-intensive. But if you’re a serious seller it can definitely be worth it.
But what are the benefits? Well, a good email list allows you to access the tried and tested realm of email marketing. It lets you precisely target the people who have shown an interest in your products for advertising so that you aren’t wasting money on the wrong target groups.
By using Facebook Ads and a targeted Amazon email list, by some estimates you can reduce costs [by 10-20%](https://landingcube.com/lookalike-audience-amazon/) relative to cold advertising.
It also gives you a bit of independence from the Amazon platform: if you branch out to other marketplaces or set up your own website, you have a list of customers who are already interested in your products and brand.
So, how do you do it?
Amazon has been clamping down on this kind of thing recently but there are other options available to you. Set up social media pages for your brand (if you’re an experienced seller you’ve probably already done this) and use them to solicit emails. This has the added benefit of only collecting the contacts of the people who are super interested in your business. You can offer them incentives like discount codes for doing this, too. Use every option in your wheelhouse.
### Tip 4: Upgrade to a professional account
No Amazon guide is complete without mention of this. If you’ve got an established business and you’re selling lots of products, this is definitely something to look into. Instead of paying $0.99 per transaction, you pay a fixed rate of $39.99 per month. I mean, even a caveman can do that math: sell more than 40 products each month and you’re saving money.
![](/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/caveman-count.gif)
A professional account grants access to restricted product categories, too: you can now dabble in things like jewelry, DVDs, and collectibles. If you want to expand your business, these are things you might want to look at.
You also receive access to some nifty tools. You get reports on volume selling and some inventory tools (although, as mentioned, these can also be obtained elsewhere – including with multi-platform functionality).
What else? Well, some tax benefits – depending on your jurisdiction it may be cheaper to be a professional seller.
### Tip 5: Leverage FBA (Fulfilment by Amazon) to offer Prime benefits
One thing I mentioned earlier that comes with a lot of benefits is FBA. The program essentially automates refunds, returns, shipping, and warehousing. That’s right, Amazon will take care of all of that: your products are in their warehouses, they pick and ship them when you make a sale (free of charge to you), and they handle any issues with returns since your goods are in their storerooms anyway. Oh, and did I mention 24/7 Amazon customer service?
The reason this is a professional tip is because small-scale sellers can handle this stuff themselves without too much hassle. And the program comes with a cost: there are Amazon fees for storage and fulfilment, and they increase with how much you have stored with them. These costs are dynamic and increase during peak seasons.
But as I said, anyone shipping big volumes is bound to profit from this program.

## Conclusion
I hope this article has been of use to you. And unless you’re already a supreme Amazon seller then I think it should have been (and if you are then why are you reading this?). Before I go, I’d like to emphasize that one of the best tips out there is to be diligent and stay on top of things since the ecommerce market is constantly changing.
And bear in mind that this article concerns only Amazon, but one of the tips I always offer to sellers is that the more places you’re selling on, the more profit you’re going to make. And with the [great tools available](https://sellbery.com/blog/multi-channel-selling.html) these days, it’s never been easier. You can easily and automatically get [Amazon integration](https://sellbery.com/integrations/amazon) that works on platforms from Amazon to eBay and Shopify (plus a dozen more) with things like synced stock levels. If you’re serious about ecommerce, this is definitely something to look into.

# Apply These 5 Secret Techniques To Improve Amazon Sales

In
[eCommerce](https://www.pimworks.io/blog/category/ecommerce/)
Did you know that 40% of Americans (NPR) buy at least once a month on Amazon?
44% of shoppers search on Amazon (which is only 11% more than Google) to find the product they’re looking for. According to similarweb, Amazon is the central hub for online shopping boasting average web traffic of 2.39B.
![](https://www.pimworks.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amazon-selling-tips-stats.png)
Customers splurge their money on Amazon. Being a successful seller on this platform is the best bet you can get. But, the real question here is how well are you utilizing the various channels through which you can improve traffic, increase visits, multiply conversions, and grow your business.
Are your efforts well distributed? Do you keep your product information contextual and customer-centric? How far has your influencer marketing strategies gone?
I have got a ton of other questions for you. I want to answer them all and help you with some useful tips if you haven’t been doing these. But, I got a better way to do this.
Today, I will be sharing in detail five amazon selling tips and tricks that’d cover most of your questions and help you move from where you are in your sales journey, for good.
## **A Five-step Guide with useful amazon selling tips and tricks**
### 1. **Growth hacking your way to increase conversions**
You know that the future of content is through videos right?
Kid you not, according to Hubspot, four of the top six channels on which global consumers watch a video are social channels.
If you are not already leveraging video content, you are losing out on a lot. By videos, I do not only mean Youtube. While influencer partnerships are the icing on the cake, other forms like Facebook live, Instagram live, Amazon live are also untapped gold mines for you to boost sales.
Plus, with tools like an [ai video generator](https://invideo.io/make/ai-video-generator/), you don’t need a large production team or studio setup to create compelling, engaging content. These tools let you transform product photos, testimonials, or even written content into social-ready videos in minutes.
First, let’s see how YouTube + Influencer outreach can help you.
By partnering with an influencer, you can multiply your brand reach. With close to 5M audience base, a video on a product you sell with links to your website, imagine the kind of reach you can achieve.
Influencers have a strong audience base (which is the same target as yours) who believe and trust in the review and recommendations from them.
But, wait.
What if you don’t find influencers for your niche?
That is when you have to diversify your presence by getting your team to be active on various social channels by constantly creating content around the uses/benefits/demos of your products. You can either go live on these channels or utilize amazon live.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20334'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Before I take you through Amazon live, be sure to build a relevant audience for your social channels and to keep the audience highly targeted through relevant use of hashtags and a candid approach to getting them to follow you in all your campaigns.
What’s **Amazon live**, anyway?
Like any other platform with the live feature, you can use Amazon live to promote your products.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20185'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
Here’s a [complete guide](https://neilpatel.com/blog/amazon-live/) on how to set this up and get it going.
You can promote your products on amazon live to improve bad awareness and sales. You can learn more tips on how to be successful with amazon live [here](https://www.amazon.com/live).
### **2. Creating the best customer experience on the planet**
This is something you’d already know.
But, customer experience is not all about the same day delivery tactic, zero shipping charges, or discounts. Customers do appreciate this, but what really keeps them hooked to your brand, become loyal customers, and make them coming back to you is the kind of personalization and support services you extend.
Personalization apart from the contextual placement of ads is about personalizing product content to every unique customer based upon the gender, age, and other demographic details that make product information relevant and engaging.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
**How to create personalized product experience?**
* Create a 360-degree view of content (include all product information, master data, and digital assets)
* Enrich product content – remove obsolete information, include all details to make it comprehensive, update data frequently, include rich digital assets
* Leverage user behavior data through analytical tracking and feedback to profile and personalize information
* Leverage [PIM solution](https://www.pimworks.io/) to create contextual product content
### 3. **Becoming easier to find – How to cut through the clutter?**
SEO can never be overlooked.
For any online business to succeed, the optimization of content is inevitable. Reason being, visibility is important to make a sale and how to achieve that is through content optimization.
* Amazon’s search engine is backed by the A10 algorithm with a basic function of bringing results that closely matches a query. The Amazon algorithm is getting smarter and complex day after day. It is not like how simple it used to be, today, it accommodates for variations in the results and misspelled words.
This gets good for you only if you are comprehensive with your optimization efforts.

***Source:*** *https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/1881?)*
[![amazon selling tips](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20331'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.pimworks.io/whitepapers/tips-tricks-and-best-practices-of-marketplace-seo.php)
***Quick tips to optimize your content***
* *Optimize the length of the title and be sure to include the primary keywords and natural for the user. No more dumping of keywords and making it clunky. A10 is more human*
* *Make product descriptions and features skimmable through bullet points*
* *Make sure images are of high quality: at least 1,000 by 500px*
* *Include long-tail keyword to rank for literal search terms*
* *Be sure to keep increasing your review count. Mindful of having only genuine ones. A10 is right out of Hogen’s alley blowing off all the black hats*
### **4. Improve seller metrics to win the buy-box**
*82% of Amazon sales go through the Buy Box.*
Amazon limits the eligibility to win the buy box for sellers with excellent metrics. It is not easy to win the buy box as Amazon has a lot of eligibility criteria to push a seller there.
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
**How to win the buy box?**
**Amazon says,**
* Your items must be new as used items are not eligible for the buy box
* You cannot run out of stock as if that happens the buy box will rotate to another seller
* Only sellers with professional seller account are eligible (sure?)
* The most successful seller stays longer in the buy box
![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20718'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
### 5. **Spice up the review game**
Did you know that more Amazon reviews mean more opportunity to sell?
*73% of consumers say positive customer reviews* ***make them trust a business more.***
Reviews are not only criteria to rank, but also a major influencer for a sale. The more reviews and the more mixed they are, the more is the build of trust in your product. Customers really read reviews of other buyers and the pictures they post to find out if they have to buy the product or not. A good bend of bad and mediocre reviews are good for your brand as all positive reviews make you seem like the reviews were not authentic.
But, how do we persuade buyers to leave a review? Do we buy reviews? That’s absolutely not what you should do as Amazon has got more stringent with their [review policies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201967050).
As of October 2016, Amazon made incentivizing product reviews or asking for positive reviews specifically, in any way a violation of their TOS and also took down all the fake reviews both manually and through AI.
***Ask for it:*** *Even if a buyer is really happy about the purchase, they’re not going to be generous enough to leave a review. You should request it by dropping an email.*
***Make it irresistible:*** *Sometimes it so happens that customers feel so good about the product and the support services. Be very friendly and helpful with support enquires, and right there will be your review.*
***Promote your reviews:*** *Promoting positive views on social channels makes your customers happy. Featuring the review acts as an incentive and attract reviews from people who already haven’t written.*
***Register your brand:*** *You can begin by logging into the seller central and choose an early review program. Enroll SKUs with less than five reviews. Amazon emails your customers asking for a review and incentivizes with $3 Amazon gift card as a value exchange.*
*You pay Amazon $60 once your first review comes in.*
## **Final word**
No matter the kind of competition there is on Amazon, making a mark for yourself is nothing short of some efforts. Consistently looking for channels and means to persuade a sale directly or indirectly is bound to help you grow your business. [Starting a business on Amazon](https://www.kanakkupillai.com/learn/start-an-ecommerce-business-on-amazon/) comes with its challenges, but the right strategies can set you on the path to success.

![A toolbox labeled "First-Time Seller Toolkit" filled with Amazon seller essentials—shipping box, calculator, checklist, gear, and magnifying glass—representing how to sell on Amazon in 2025 with the right tools.](https://www.sellerlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/How-to-Sell-on-Amazon-in-2025-The-Ultimate-Beginners-Step-by-Step-Guide.png)
Thinking about starting your Amazon business in 2025? You’re not alone—and you’re right on time.
With over 300 million active Amazon users and third-party sellers now driving over 60% of all product sales, selling on Amazon has never been more promising. But success isn’t as simple as listing an item and hoping for the best. You need a smart strategy, the right tools, and a roadmap that works in today’s market.
Welcome to your step-by-step beginner’s guide to selling on Amazon in 2025—built to educate, empower, and help you launch confidently.
## **Step 1: Create Your Amazon Seller Account**
Start by registering your account on [Amazon Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com).
Choose between:
* **Individual**: No monthly fee, but $0.99 per sale.
* **Professional**: $39.99/month—ideal for serious sellers with more than 40 sales/month.
**Pro Tip:** Go with **Professional** if you want access to advertising, bulk listings, and advanced selling tools.
## **Step 2: Understand Amazon Selling Models**
Before sourcing your first product, know your model:
* **FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)**: Amazon handles shipping, returns, and customer service.
* **FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)**: You manage inventory and shipping yourself.
* **Private Label**: Sell your own branded products (requires upfront investment).
* **Retail Arbitrage**: Reselling discounted items you source locally.
* **Wholesale**: Buy bulk inventory from distributors to resell on Amazon.
💡 Want sourcing ideas? Explore**[10 Best Product Sourcing Alternatives to China](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/product-sourcing-alternatives-amazon-2025/)** and **[Top Sourcing & Fulfillment Companies](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-sourcing-fulfillment-2025/)** to diversify amid 2025’s shifting tariff landscape.
## **Step 3: Select Profitable Products to Sell**
Choosing the right product can make or break your Amazon journey.
Use [Amazon’s Product Opportunity Explorer](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/product-opportunity-explorer#:~:text=English%20%2D%20US-,Product%20Opportunity%20Explorer,profitable%20new%20products%20to%20sell.) to evaluate:
* Search volume and trends
* Market competition
* Conversion rates
* Seasonal patterns
📈 Temporary 2025 tariff cuts may boost margins for electronics and tools, but with potential reintroductions looming, product diversification remains essential.
📦 *Looking for product inspiration?* Check out our blog for **[Top-Selling Products of 2025](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-best-sellers-2025/).**
## **Step 4: Source Your Product**
Once you’ve identified your niche:
* Connect with suppliers via Alibaba, IndiaMART, or local vendors.
* Verify legitimacy: ask for references, samples, and documentation.
* Compare pricing, minimum order quantities, and shipping timelines.
* Request product testing and quality assurance checks.
🛡 Use our [**How to Vet Overseas Suppliers in 2025 Guide**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/vet-overseas-suppliers-2025-guide/) to avoid costly mistakes.
## **Step 5: Set Up and Optimize Your Listings**
Your product page is your storefront. It must convert browsers into buyers.
Here’s what makes a great listing:
* Keyword-rich product title (use Amazon’s [title compliance guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/G200386300))
* Compelling bullet points highlighting features and benefits
* High-quality product images (minimum 1000px resolution)
* A+ Content (available to Brand Registered sellers)
📌 Explore our complete guide to [**Amazon listing optimization**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-seo-how-to-optimize-your-product-listings-for-higher-rankings-sales/) to make sure your product pages are fully optimized from day one.
## **Step 6: Set Your Price and Shipping**
When pricing your product, factor in:
* Cost of goods sold (COGS)
* FBA and referral fees
* Shipping and tariffs
* Ad spend (ACoS)
* Competitor pricing
💰 **Pro Tip:** Avoid pricing too low—focus on delivering value and building brand trust.
## **Step 7: Use Extensions and Tools to Analyze Competition**
Get insights with browser extensions like:
* [**Keepa**](https://keepa.com/#!addon): Track product price history
* [**How Many Extension**](https://howmanyextension.com/): Estimate competitors’ sales volume and inventory
* **[Amazon DS Quick View](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ds-amazon-quick-view/jkompbllimaoekaogchhkmkdogpkhojg?hl=en)**: See seller counts and ranks directly in Amazon search
These tools offer a competitive edge and help inform your product strategy.
## **Step 8: Manage Inventory and Fulfillment**
Avoid stockouts and costly overages with:
* Real-time restock alerts
* Forecasting tools
* Smart reorder recommendations
✅ The [**Seller Labs Restock App**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-restock-limits-2025-strategy/) helps sellers stay compliant with Amazon’s restock limits. It offers data-backed restock recommendations based on SKU velocity, profitability, and seasonality.
## **Step 9: Launch Ads and Get Traffic**
Once you’re live, drive traffic with:
* **Sponsored Products Ads**
* **Lightning Deals and Coupons**
* **External Traffic** like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Google Shopping
Monitor your campaigns weekly, adjust bids, and pause poor performers. Keep an eye on your **Advertising Cost of Sale (ACoS)** for profitability—and consider using [**Ad Genius**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/ad-genius/) to automate optimizations and uncover wasted ad spend.
## **Step 10: Monitor Performance and Scale**
Keep your business running smoothly by tracking:
* Customer reviews and seller feedback
* Amazon’s performance metrics and notifications
* Inventory Performance Index (IPI) score
* Ad ROI and profitability by SKU
💡 [**The Genius Bundle from Seller Labs**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/products/) helps Amazon sellers streamline operations and grow smarter with tools like:

![The Hottest Amazon Finds You Can't Miss This Year](https://nimbuspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Hottest-Amazon-Finds-You-Cant-Miss-This-Year.jpg)

Are we good to go, folks? Let’s dig in!
## The Rise of Smart Shoppers: Trends That Dominate Online Buying
Gone are the days when online shopping was just about convenience — today’s shoppers are smarter, faster, and more informed than ever. In 2025, the rise of smart shopping is driven by a perfect storm of mobile accessibility, AI-powered recommendations, influencer culture, and lightning-fast delivery options. Consumers are no longer just buying products; they’re buying into experiences, values, and trends that align with their lifestyles.
Smart shoppers rely on reviews, compare prices in real time, follow trending deals on social media, and often make data-driven decisions. They’re using tools like price trackers, cashback extensions, and AI chatbots to get the best bang for their buck. On Amazon, this shift is crystal clear — from eco-friendly choices and budget bundles to limited-time lightning deals, what’s trending reflects a more mindful, tech-savvy customer base.
Understanding these trends not only helps customers shop smarter but also opens doors for brands and sellers looking to stand out in a crowded digital marketplace. The message is clear: In 2025, it’s not just about buying more — it’s about buying better.

### Clothing & Jewellery
Fashion products consistently rank among the top-selling items in India, as highlighted in the latest PPRO report. The report indicates that the fashion category commands a significant market share of around 27% across various eCommerce segments.
Jewellery is another highly sought-after category, traditionally popular among Indian women, and now gaining traction among men, especially in the form of customised jewellery.
That said, if you’re planning to enter this space, it’s crucial to focus on uniqueness. With competition running high, offering generic fashion or jewellery items won’t be enough. Instead, identify products that stand out — items with a distinct style, utility, or cultural appeal.
Some of the best-selling products on Amazon within the category include:
* Unisex fashion apparel
* Activewear and sportswear
* Undergarments and swimwear
* Sarees and ethnic wear
* Kurtis and fusion outfits
* Trendy and customisable jewellery
The key is to go beyond what’s already out there and find a niche that speaks to evolving customer preferences.
### Beauty & Personal Care Products

## Why You Should Sell on Amazon India
There are several reasons why you should sell on Amazon India. Here are a few:
### Rising Demand
According to the [IBEF](https://www.ibef.org/industry/ecommerce.aspx), India’s e-commerce industry is projected to reach US$ 99 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 27% during 2019-24. Categories such as grocery and apparel are likely to experience incremental growth.
Increasing internet penetration coupled with the growth in organized sectors within retail markets boosts the e-commerce needs in India. Besides, the government policies regarding FDIs will further accelerate the e-commerce marketplace growth in India.
All these factors are strong reasons for the rising demand in the e-commerce industry.
### Logistics
Besides Flipkart, Amazon is the most trusted and user-friendly e-commerce marketplace in India. Amazon Prime offers expedited delivery for its shoppers. Its high-speed logistics capabilities give Amazon a competitive edge. So sellers should definitely use it to their advantage.
### SellerApp’s Tools are Now Available for Indian Marketplace Sellers
[Product research](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-product-research/), keyword research, and advertising are the cornerstones of a successful Amazon business. With that in mind, our experts at [SellerApp](https://www.sellerapp.com) have brought the expertise to India.
Our robust and most popular tools like the Product research tool, [Keyword research tool](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/why-sellerapp-keyword-research-great/), and Advertising suite are now available for Indian marketplace sellers.
### Product Sourcing
Many [international sellers](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/sell-on-amazon-internationally/) rely on Indian manufacturers to source their products. It is one of the largest manufacturing hubs in the world, after China. So [product sourcing](https://www.sellerapp.com/product-sourcing.html) from India will definitely boost your profits. Besides, maintaining business relations and networks gets easy if you’re an India-based seller.
In a nutshell, it is the perfect time to start selling on Amazon India if you haven’t already.
## How to sell on Amazon India
Not every business is created equal. So you should pick a business model that works for you and follow these simple steps mentioned below.
### Find a Killer Product
The first step to selling on Amazon is to find a killer product that you would love to sell. Before you start your product research, I want to remind you one thing – A top seller on the Amazon US marketplace doesn’t have to be a top seller on Amazon India. The demand is unique for different products on one marketplace compared to the others. So I suggest you use SellerApp’s [product research feature](https://www.sellerapp.com/product-research.html) to find the best-selling products in India.
You might start selling just one product initially. However, if you want to really make some good profits, you need to expand your portfolio and sell a whole range of products on Amazon. Take a close look at the market to see what works and what doesn’t. Then, jump on the bandwagon with solid product research.
### Requirements to Sell on Amazon.in
First, you need access to Amazon seller central to sell on Amazon.in.
In order to register:
* You need to have an active bank account.
* Keep the GST/PAN information of your business handy.
Here are the steps you encounter when you register on Amazon seller central platform.
* Go to sell.amazon.in and click on ‘Start Selling’
* If you have a buyer account, you can use the same credentials to login, or you can also click on ‘Create your Amazon account’
* You will need to fill in the required information during the account creation process
* Give your company name or the registered name on your GST. Accept the terms and conditions
* Enter your mobile number and complete the verification process
* Now you have to input your ‘Store name,’ ‘[amazon Product Category](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-product-categories-tree/),’ and address.
* Activate or deactivate the Whatsapp notification service and submit the details
Amazon will take some time to validate your details. Once that is done, you have to enable the two-step verification process that offers you better security to guard your seller account. Then, you have to enter your tax details.
**Note:** For certain products that are not covered under GST, GST registration isn’t required. So make sure you check the required details before you register your seller account on Amazon.in. [Here’s the list](https://sell.amazon.in/seller-blog/a-to-z-gst-guide.html) of FAQs that Amazon gave to clarify sellers’ queries on GST registration.
Once you created the account, you need to list your products on the marketplace. You can either add a product from Amazon’s catalog or create a new listing for your product.
## How to Maximize Profits on Amazon
When you start selling on Amazon.in, you need to ensure that your business stays profitable. Here are a few things to keep in mind to stay profitable on Amazon.
### Product Bundles and Promotions
From a profit standpoint, product bundles and promotions offer little risk and more benefits. [Buyers like saving on deals](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/plan-for-amazon-prime-day-lightning-deals/), purchasing expensive products at discounts. This route is beneficial for you because of the high sales volume you get with the discounts. Moreover, there’d be less competition when it comes to bundling your products.
Keep in mind that when you [amazon bundle products](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-virtual-product-bundles-program/), you need to create a new listing most of the time.
### Capitalize on The Competition
If you are competing with some major brands in your niche, sometimes, it can be hard to rank better than their products. From my experience, I can say that a product ranking on the first page of the search results grabs 70-80% of sales, while a product ranking in fourth can grab only 0-10% of the sales. That’s substantial!
You need to rank on the first page to grow your market share on Amazon. To outrank your competition, here are a few things you can follow:
* Identify the right competitors
* Track competitor’s keywords
* Target them with PPC campaigns
* Set pricing and Buy Box alerts on your competitors
* [Use reviews and ratings](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/best-amazon-review-strategy/) to your advantage
Need more information on how to outrank your competition? Check out this [link here](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-product-listing-ranking-strategies/).
### Effective Inventory Management
Without having a grip on your [amazon inventory management](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/best-amazon-inventory-management-tools/), it’s hard to stay profitable in your Amazon business. Seeing a product goes out of stock can be frustrating for a seller. Amazon doesn’t want that too.
#### Slow down when needed
A good sales strategy does not maximize sales but will not lose a single one. If your advertising campaigns or pricing strategies are incredible, your sales can shoot up the roof and can lead to inventory exhaustion. If this happens, and you are unable to maintain the demand-supply cycle, it can lead to out-of-stock or delay in deliveries. Furthermore, your BSR and product ranks get hampered leading to a cascading effect on your future sales.
There are certain ways to slow down your sales when you foresee an out-of-stock situation such as increasing prices or shipping time, etc. However, these methods are not entirely ideal. So the best way to manage your inventory effectively is to predict your sales and keep track of your inventory ahead.
### Repricing Strategies
If you want to increase your profits on Amazon, you should constantly track the prices of your products. With the changing demand, prices of items frequently change on any [online marketplace](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/best-marketplaces-to-sell-products-online/) including Amazon. You always need to keep up with them. Having a [repricing tool](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-repricing-growth-stack/) or setting a price alert on your competition makes your job much easier. You can use SellerApp’s [‘Business alerts’ tool](https://www.sellerapp.com/business-alerts.html) to keep a tab on your competitors.

### Amazon Advertising
Amazon PPC campaigns are a great addition to your marketing funnel. A successful PPC campaign can bring you more sales and help you rank high in the search results. With the rising popularity of sponsored ads and a growing number of sellers, PPC campaigns are definitely a must if you want to scale your Amazon business.
### Holiday Sales
Make the best use of special events and holiday sales. Events such as Cyber Monday, [Amazon Prime Day sale](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-prime-day/), the Great Indian Festival sale, and other holidays are crucial for Amazon sellers. Ensure you’re all stocked up to handle a flood of orders. Along with that, start running your PPC campaigns ahead of time, so you stay on top of the competition and win maximum sales.
Amazon India is a nascent market with huge growth potential for brands and e-commerce entrepreneurs. So make sure you get the most out of it in order to reap the maximum benefits. To keep up with the industry trends, make sure you follow our YouTube channel.
Modern ways to sell on INDIA – Did you know about **ONDC** ?
ONDC is a network that enables location-aware, local digital commerce stores across industries to be discovered and engaged by any network-enabled applications. It is neither a super [aggregator](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-aggregators-business-guide/) app nor a hosting platform. All existing digital commerce apps and platforms can voluntarily choose to adopt and be a part of the ONDC network. In addition, the responsibility for onboarding of sellers and buyers and the management of the end-to-end order lifecycle will also continue to reside with the network-enabled applications.

# How To Find Products To Sell on Amazon and Generate Profit
Succeeding on Amazon as a seller depends largely on finding profitable products. But with so many options out there, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start. There are many ways to choose which items to sell on Amazon, each with its own characteristics. You don’t have to rely on just one approach - by understanding each method, you can combine them effectively for optimal results.
In this article, we’ll share the top 10 strategies to help Amazon sellers find winning products to sell.
10 Ways to Find the Best Amazon Products
1. [Apply Filters to Amazon’s Product Database](#ApplyFilterstoAmazon’sProductDatabase)
2. [Use Amazon Analytical Software](#UseAmazonAnalyticalSoftware)
3. [Attend Webinars and Other Special Events](#AttendWebinarsandOtherSpecialEvents)
4. [Use Keyword Data](#UseKeywordData)
5. [Outsource Your Research](#OutsourceYourResearch)
6. [Review Trend Reports](#ReviewTrendReports)
7. [Check Out External Marketplaces](#CheckOutExternalMarketplaces)
8. [Utilize the Amazon ‘Best Sellers’ Page](#UtilizetheAmazon‘BestSellers’Page)
9. [Leverage Social Media for Product Ideas](#LeverageSocialMediaforProductIdeas)
10. [Generate Product Ideas with AI](#GenerateProductIdeaswithAI)
## Method 1: Apply Filters to Amazon’s Product Database
The most straightforward way to select products for your store is to explore Amazon directly. To refine your search and narrow down your options, consider defining specific criteria that fit your needs. Below, you'll find examples of the criteria experienced sellers use to identify profitable products for Amazon FBA:
* **High demand:** Top sellers typically look for products that generate a minimum of 300 sales/month (or 10 sales/day).
* **Minimal competition:** Niches where the top sellers have received less than 400 reviews have more likelihood of being noticed.
* **Size and weight:** Choose products that weigh less than 5 lbs and whose size measures less than 18”x14”x8”. Items that are heavier and larger cost more to store and ship.
* **Sales price between $30-70:** Sellers tend to choose products priced high enough to make money, but not so high that they seem too expensive to buyers.
* **Price is four times higher than the cost:** Sellers find products where the sourcing costs are 25% of your sales price.
These are not all of the available criteria. You can also select a specific product category, the number of other sellers, and more. Choosing a product manually from millions of products that fits your criteria is difficult and time-consuming. To help you find matching products quickly, use the AMZScout Product Database.
### Get a Quick List of Products that Match Your Criteria
AMZScout’s Product Database provides data on millions of Amazon products, and features 16 filters to help you focus on those that best meet your needs.
Here’s how to find products to sell on Amazon:
**Step 1:** [**Go to the AMZScout Product Database**](https://amzscout.net/app/#/database?menu_onboarding=false)**.** If you are not registered, you will see a sign-up form. Complete the form to start your free trial.
**Step 2: Enter your product criteria.** There are many filters to help you refine your precise criteria. For example, you can use one filter to find products with specific rating counts. You can also use the premade “*Product Selections*” or the suggestions above if you need help.

**Step 2: Search for a product on Amazon.** Enter the name of the product you want to analyze into Amazon's search bar. Then, click the icon in the top-right corner of the page to access the PRO AI Extension.
**Step 3: Assess how the product aligns with your business model.** Click the "Estimated Sales" column to sort by top sales. Check the *Product Score* next to the item that catches your eye to see if it’s better for reselling or private label, and review the reasons behind the score.
**Step 4: Review the product's performance.** Click on any product you're interested in and select “Product History” to view the graph with the following metrics:
* **Sales and pricing history:** Review the sales data and pricing changes to confirm that there are no significant drops, and that the trend is stable or increasing.

## Method 4: Use Keyword Data
One of the best ways to find out what is selling well is to see which keywords receive the most searches online. There are a couple of methods how to get this info:
* **Check autosuggestions**: Start by typing keywords into Amazon and Google search bars to see commonly searched terms related to your product.
* **Check reviews**: Analyze customer reviews to identify frequently mentioned words and phrases that are important to your target audience.
* **Use keyword tools**: Leverage tools like Google Trends to track the popularity of search terms over time and across regions.
To maximize this method, you can also use keyword finders specifically designed for Amazon that provide detailed data associated with certain keywords. A top choice among Amazon sellers is AMZScout’s Keyword Search.
Here is how to use it:
**Step 1:** [**Go to AMZScout’s Keyword Search Tool**](https://amzscout.net/app/#/keywords?menu_onboarding=false)**.**
**Step 2: Enter the name of any product or niche you want to explore** (for example, shirts, kitchen items, toys for babies, etc.).You can also opt to include additional search criteria, such as keyword count and search volume.
**Step 3: Get keywords.** Click "Find Keywords" to retrieve a list of the keywords.
**Step 4: Make a list of potential product ideas.** Analyze the keyword results by examining both the search volume and the search volume history month-by-month over the past year. This helps you see if a trend is seasonal with big fluctuations, or evergreen with steady demand.

## Method 7: Check Out External Marketplaces
Other eCommerce marketplaces (some of them big) are worth looking at so you can find out what’s popular across the web.
Here are some steps you can follow when checking out these other marketplaces:
**Step 1: Review trending products.** On various online marketplaces, explore sections like eBay’s “Explore Popular Categories” or Alibaba’s “What’s Trending Now”.
**Step 2: Create a list of potential products based on your criteria.**
**Step 3: Then, find these products on Amazon and check how well they rank.**
This approach helps you find trending products to sell on Amazon, as popular items on one site often expand to others. You can also buy underpriced items to resell on different marketplaces, which is a strategy called ‘[online arbitrage](https://amzscout.net/blog/online-arbitrage/)’.
## Method 8: Utilize the Amazon ‘Best Sellers’ Page
Checking the Amazon ‘Best Sellers’ Page is the easiest way to find top selling products on Amazon. Below is a list of quick steps to follow:
**Step 1: Access the Amazon Best Sellers Page.** Select a category that interests you.
**Step 2: Refine your search.** Click through the sub-categories to narrow down your search.
**Step 3: Compile a list of products that meet your personal criteria.**
The list of Amazon Best Sellers is updated hourly based on recent sales data, which can reflect temporary trends. Therefore, it's important to assess trends and competition levels before making a decision. Use the [methods](#PROguide) described earlier to determine if a product has long-term profit potential and is worth your investment.
## Method 9: Leverage Social Media for Product Ideas
Social media platforms are a great option if you’re wondering where to find product ideas for free, and they’re perfect places for users to browse trending topics. This includes popular products they want to buy, providing inspiration for potential brand-name or white-label products you might use.
Here’s how you can use social media for product ideas:
**Step 1: Check trending products.** Examine influencer posts, hashtags, and popular content on popular platforms like Instagram or [TikTok](https://amzscout.net/blog/tiktok-made-me-buy-it-products/).
**Step 2: Identify products that catch your eye.** Look at comments and reactions to help you gauge interest.
**Step 3: Search for these products on Amazon.** Add the product to your list (especially if it's not on Amazon).
To keep up with changing demand, it’s important to monitor social media regularly for trend updates and product ideas. However, since this method doesn’t provide any sales data or other relevant information, consider using analytical tools to confirm a product’s profitability and suitability for your business model.
###
## Method 10: Generate Product Ideas with AI
Modern technology streamlines many aspects of our daily lives, and AI can be a valuable tool for generating product ideas to sell on Amazon. For instance, [ChatGPT](https://amzscout.net/blog/using-chatgpt-to-find-products-to-sell/) offers a free version that can help you brainstorm product ideas based on your business goals and product preferences.
However, you also need to remember that AI-generated research should complement traditional methods, as the data may not always be current or precise. Be sure to verify and cross-check the information to ensure its relevance and accuracy.
Each method described above has its pros and cons and is worth considering. Sellers needn’t rely on just one approach, as combining methods can provide a more comprehensive market view. By conducting thorough research, you’ll improve your likelihood of business success.
## Tips for Increasing Revenue
Now that we've covered how to find profitable products, let's explore a few tips from Amazon's top sellers to help boost your sales. Here are the top three strategies to help you increase your earnings:
* **Differentiate yourself from competitors:** For your own brand, consider using the “AI Product Improvement” option in the PRO AI Extension to discover ways to improve any product and increase its sales potential.
