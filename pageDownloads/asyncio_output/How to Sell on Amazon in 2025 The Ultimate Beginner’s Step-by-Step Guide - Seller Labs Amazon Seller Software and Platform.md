Thinking about starting your Amazon business in 2025? Youâ€™re not aloneâ€”and youâ€™re right on time.

With over 300 million active Amazon users and third-party sellers now driving over 60% of all product sales, selling on Amazon has never been more promising. But success isnâ€™t as simple as listing an item and hoping for the best. You need a smart strategy, the right tools, and a roadmap that works in todayâ€™s market.

Welcome to your step-by-step beginnerâ€™s guide to selling on Amazon in 2025â€”built to educate, empower, and help you launch confidently.

## **Step 1: Create Your Amazon Seller Account**

Start by registering your account on [Amazon Seller Central](https://sellercentral.amazon.com).

Choose between:

* **Individual**: No monthly fee, but $0.99 per sale.
* **Professional**: $39.99/monthâ€”ideal for serious sellers with more than 40 sales/month.

**Pro Tip:** Go with **Professional** if you want access to advertising, bulk listings, and advanced selling tools.

## **Step 2: Understand Amazon Selling Models**

Before sourcing your first product, know your model:

* **FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon)**: Amazon handles shipping, returns, and customer service.
* **FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)**: You manage inventory and shipping yourself.
* **Private Label**: Sell your own branded products (requires upfront investment).
* **Retail Arbitrage**: Reselling discounted items you source locally.
* **Wholesale**: Buy bulk inventory from distributors to resell on Amazon.

ðŸ’¡ Want sourcing ideas? Explore**[10 Best Product Sourcing Alternatives to China](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/product-sourcing-alternatives-amazon-2025/)** and **[Top Sourcing & Fulfillment Companies](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-sourcing-fulfillment-2025/)** to diversify amid 2025â€™s shifting tariff landscape.

## **Step 3: Select Profitable Products to Sell**

Choosing the right product can make or break your Amazon journey.

Use [Amazonâ€™s Product Opportunity Explorer](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/product-opportunity-explorer#:~:text=English%20%2D%20US-,Product%20Opportunity%20Explorer,profitable%20new%20products%20to%20sell.) to evaluate:

* Search volume and trends
* Market competition
* Conversion rates
* Seasonal patterns

ðŸ“ˆ Temporary 2025 tariff cuts may boost margins for electronics and tools, but with potential reintroductions looming, product diversification remains essential.

ðŸ“¦ *Looking for product inspiration?* Check out our blog for **[Top-Selling Products of 2025](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-best-sellers-2025/).**

## **Step 4: Source Your Product**

Once youâ€™ve identified your niche:

* Connect with suppliers via Alibaba, IndiaMART, or local vendors.
* Verify legitimacy: ask for references, samples, and documentation.
* Compare pricing, minimum order quantities, and shipping timelines.
* Request product testing and quality assurance checks.

ðŸ›¡ Use our [**How to Vet Overseas Suppliers in 2025 Guide**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/vet-overseas-suppliers-2025-guide/) to avoid costly mistakes.

## **Step 5: Set Up and Optimize Your Listings**

Your product page is your storefront. It must convert browsers into buyers.

Hereâ€™s what makes a great listing:

* Keyword-rich product title (use Amazonâ€™s [title compliance guidelines](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/G200386300))
* Compelling bullet points highlighting features and benefits
* High-quality product images (minimum 1000px resolution)
* A+ Content (available to Brand Registered sellers)

ðŸ“Œ Explore our complete guide to [**Amazon listing optimization**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-seo-how-to-optimize-your-product-listings-for-higher-rankings-sales/) to make sure your product pages are fully optimized from day one.

## **Step 6: Set Your Price and Shipping**

When pricing your product, factor in:

* Cost of goods sold (COGS)
* FBA and referral fees
* Shipping and tariffs
* Ad spend (ACoS)
* Competitor pricing

ðŸ’° **Pro Tip:** Avoid pricing too lowâ€”focus on delivering value and building brand trust.

## **Step 7: Use Extensions and Tools to Analyze Competition**

Get insights with browser extensions like:

* [**Keepa**](https://keepa.com/#!addon): Track product price history
* [**How Many Extension**](https://howmanyextension.com/): Estimate competitorsâ€™ sales volume and inventory
* **[Amazon DS Quick View](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ds-amazon-quick-view/jkompbllimaoekaogchhkmkdogpkhojg?hl=en)**: See seller counts and ranks directly in Amazon search

These tools offer a competitive edge and help inform your product strategy.

## **Step 8: Manage Inventory and Fulfillment**

Avoid stockouts and costly overages with:

* Real-time restock alerts
* Forecasting tools
* Smart reorder recommendations

âœ… The [**Seller Labs Restock App**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/blog/amazon-restock-limits-2025-strategy/) helps sellers stay compliant with Amazonâ€™s restock limits. It offers data-backed restock recommendations based on SKU velocity, profitability, and seasonality.

## **Step 9: Launch Ads and Get Traffic**

Once youâ€™re live, drive traffic with:

* **Sponsored Products Ads**
* **Lightning Deals and Coupons**
* **External Traffic** like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Google Shopping

Monitor your campaigns weekly, adjust bids, and pause poor performers. Keep an eye on your **Advertising Cost of Sale (ACoS)** for profitabilityâ€”and consider using [**Ad Genius**](https://www.sellerlabs.com/ad-genius/) to automate optimizations and uncover wasted ad spend.

## **Step 10: Monitor Performance and Scale**

Keep your business running smoothly by tracking:

* Customer reviews and seller feedback
* Amazonâ€™s performance metrics and notifications
* Inventory Performance Index (IPI) score
* Ad ROI and profitability by SKU
