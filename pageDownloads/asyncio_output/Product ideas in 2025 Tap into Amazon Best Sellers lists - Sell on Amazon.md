## **4 strategies to find product ideas**

### 1. Put your own spin on trending products

If you’re interested in a specific product or category, ask yourself if you can improve on what’s already selling well. This can help you identify unique product ideas and determine what to sell in the Amazon store. Try these strategies:

* **Look for higher demand, lower competition products:** You may see high-demand products, but what’s the competition like? Reviews can give you an idea. Generally, high-demand products with a lower number of reviews indicate lower competition—and a potential opportunity for you.
* **Use product reviews to guide product improvements**:Browse [product reviews](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/customer-reviews) to understand customer feedback. Write down the pros and cons, and look for areas where you can exceed customer expectations by offering something different.
* **Get creative**:Is there something you can do to make a trending product unique? Can the product be sold all year? Could you [launch a product](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/product-launch) of better quality?

## How to get started with your product idea

Even with the best product ideas, you don’t want to run into issues procuring, listing, or getting them to customers. Before you decide what to sell, consider how you’ll:

1. Source products
2. Get products to customers
3. List products to drive traffic
4. Share products with customers online
5. Market products to boost sales

Let’s explore some these points and how they can play into your business strategy.

### 1. Procurement: Sourcing products

After you’ve narrowed down what to sell, the next step is figuring out how you’ll source products.

As an online business owner, you have several options. Will you resell existing products? Or maybe you plan to make your own products? Another option is working with a manufacturer to make products according to your specifications, or produce branded items.

Different procurement methods come with different considerations. Learn about some of the ins and outs with our [ecommerce business guide](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/start-ecommerce-business).
