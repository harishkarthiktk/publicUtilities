# pageDownloads

## Purpose
I often need to save webpages locally to augment to my knowledge base.
The most straight forward way of doing it is by downloading it as html using the browser's save-as functionality.

But being a programmer, we will spend an hour building tools to do an activity that would have taken a few minutes.

## Usage
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to a text file with URLs, one per line.
  -u URL, --url URL     A single URL to process.
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save the output files.

## Disclaimer
Web scrapping and downloading of files might be in breach of T&C of the targeted websites, and this tool is strictly for personal use.
Use with caution and ethical considerations, and the liability of the tool usage lies with the user themselves.
