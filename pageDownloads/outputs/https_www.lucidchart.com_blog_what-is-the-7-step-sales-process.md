  7. Follow-up

If you are one of the 2.5 million employees in the United States working in
sales, you know that even for the most natural salesperson, it can sometimes
be difficult to turn potential leads into closed sales. Across industries, you
need different skills and knowledge to prove to your potential customers that
your solution is best for their particular problem.

The seven-step sales process outlined in business textbooks is a good start,
especially since leading sales ops teams attribute to [60% or more of their
total pipeline](https://www.statista.com/statistics/960853/number-employed-
sales-people-us-occupation) in any quarter to actively designed and deployed
sales plays. The seven-step sales process is not only a good start to
customizing it to your particular business but more importantly, customizing
it to your target customers as you move them through the [sales
funnel](/blog/visualizing-the-sales-funnel).

[![7-step sales process](https://corporate-

As the old adage goes, “Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like
an artist.” Once you’ve mastered the seven steps of the sales process you
might learn in a business class or sales seminar, then you can break the rules
where necessary to create a sales process that may not necessarily follow
procedure but gets results.

## The textbook 7-step sales process

What are the seven steps of the sales process according to most sales masters?
The following steps provide a good outline for what you should be doing to
find potential customers, close the sale, and retain your clients for repeat
business and referrals in the future.

### 1\. Prospecting

The first step in the sales process is [prospecting](/blog/sales-prospecting-
tips). In this stage, you find potential customers and determine whether they
have a need for your product or service—and whether they can afford what you
offer. Evaluating whether the customers need your product or service and can
afford it is known as qualifying.

Keep in mind that, in modern sales, it's not enough to find one prospect at a
company: There are an average of 6.8 customer stakeholders involved in a
typical purchase, so you'll want to practice [multi-threading](/blog/multi-
threaded-sales-approach), or connecting with multiple decision-makers on the
purchasing side. [Account maps](/blog/benefits-of-account-mapping) are an
effective way of identifying these buyers.

### 2\. Preparation

The next step is preparing for initial contact with a potential customer,
researching the market and collecting all relevant information regarding your
product or service. Develop your sales presentation and tailor it to your
potential client’s particular needs. Preparation is key to setting you up for
success. The better you understand your prospect and their needs, the better
you can address their objections and set yourself apart from the competition.

### 3\. Approach

Next, make first contact with your client. This is called the approach.
Sometimes this is a face-to-face meeting, sometimes it’s over the phone. There
are three common approach methods.

  * **Premium approach:** Presenting your potential client with a gift at the beginning of your interaction
  * **Question approach:** Asking a question to get the prospect interested
  * **Product approach:** Giving the prospect a sample or a free trial to review and evaluate your service



![pre-sales process](https://corporate-
assets.lucid.co/chart/f1f59956-002c-44b5-86f3-db2a7b8f70c3.png?v=1707833012718)

Dive deeper into the various sales approaches you can use to start a
relationship off on the right foot.

[Learn more](/blog/4-effective-sales-approaches)

### 4\. Presentation

In the presentation phase, you actively demonstrate how your product or
service meets the needs of your potential customer. The word presentation
implies using PowerPoint and giving a salesy spiel, but it doesn’t always have
to be that way—you should actively listen to your customer’s needs and then
act and respond accordingly.

### 5\. Handling objections

Perhaps the most underrated step of the sales process is [handling
objections](/blog/5-key-insights-for-handling-sales-objections). This is where
you listen to your prospect’s concerns and address them. It’s also where many
unsuccessful salespeople drop out of the process—44% of salespeople abandoning
pursuit after one rejection, 22% after two rejections, 14% after three, and
12% after four, even though 80% of sales require at least five follow-ups to
convert. Successfully handling objections and alleviating concerns separates
good salespeople from bad and great from good.

[![objections flowchart example](https://corporate-

"Image link")Use this flowchart to map out objections and link to relevant

### 6\. Closing

In the closing stage, you get the decision from the client to move forward.
Depending on your business, you might try one of these three [closing
techniques](/blog/sales-closing-techniques).

  * **Alternative choice close:** Assuming the sale and offering the prospect a choice, where both options close the sale—for example, “Will you be paying the whole fee up front or in installments?” or “Will that be cash or charge?”
  * **Extra inducement close:** Offering something extra to get the prospect to close, such as a free month of service or a discount
  * **Standing room only close:** Creating urgency by expressing that time is of the essence—for example, “The price will be going up after this month” or “We only have six spots left”

### 7\. Follow-up

Once you have closed the sale, your job is not done. The follow-up stage keeps
you in contact with customers you have closed, not only for potential repeat
business but for referrals as well. And since retaining current customers is
six to seven times less costly than acquiring new ones, maintaining
relationships is key.

## Sales process takeaways: What’s important?

Now that you understand the basic seven stages of sales process development,
you can begin to tailor them to your own product or service and customer base.
Cut out steps that are unnecessary to your particular business and focus on
your customer. You know the rules—now get ready to break them in ways that
bring you closer to your customer and turn you from a sales professional to a
sales artist.

Whatever approach you take, keep these fundamentals in mind:

### Identifying the customer’s problem

You have a product or service you want to sell—now what? Anyone with a problem
related to your area of expertise can be a potential customer. You'll need to
dive deep into [discovery work](/blog/how-mastering-the-discovery-call-
improves-buyer-experience) to learn each buyer's specific goals, needs, and
pain points.

### Develop a solution for the customer

Once you have uncovered problems for your products to solve, tailor your
offerings to fix those issues—and be prepared to explain how your product
truly is a solution for the given problems. [Sales engineers can use
Lucidchart](/blog/how-sales-engineers-can-save-time-in-lucidchart) to visually
demonstrate how their product or service solves client problems and makes
their lives easier, such as the flowchart below.

### Be persistent

Following up isn’t just for after the close to get repeat business. As stated
before, most customers don’t buy right away. You have to handle objections and
try, try, try again. This is where the seven-step sales process doesn’t
account for repeated approaches, presentations, meetings, or phone calls where
you handle objections. If it did, it might be a 13-step sales process or a
21-step sales process, or… you get the idea.

Bottom line: stay connected—set up a calendar for repeated contact with
potential, present, and past customers so you're more likely to reach them
when they're ready to buy.

What are the key steps in the sales process? Whatever your customers need them
to be.

Once you’ve tried out a few different approaches, tweaking the original seven
steps in the sales process to fit your customers better, document your
successes so that you can follow the steps that work best and easily get new
reps up to speed as they are onboarded.

Whatever steps you settle on, you need to document your sales process to
ensure that sales reps follow it. Learn about sales process mapping.
