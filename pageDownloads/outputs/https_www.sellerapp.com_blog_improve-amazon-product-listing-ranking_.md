Amazon uses the [Amazon product
listing](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-product-listing-guide/) content
to decide your search rank when a customer searches for something. The product
list content should not only aim at providing relevant information to the
customer  
but also hit on the right [Amazon SEO
strategy](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-seo-guide/) so that more and
more people get to see your product listing upon searching.

Your first goal should be to rank your products for the most profitable
keywords on Amazon. Over time your listing will naturally rank the best for
your profitable keyword on Google. Following are the 7 places your keywords
should be present on your listing. These are more than enough to ensure that
your profitable keywords work without having to force them into any section.
Having your keywords ‘sprinkled’ throughout your Amazon product listing is
really important to help your sales to grow.

The title of your listing is one of the most important parts of your Amazon
product listing. Generally speaking titles under 80 characters are preferred
by Amazon. Going for extra long titles could also lead to the product listing
being suppressed and is definitely not something that you would want. Also in
the mobile app, titles get truncated if more than 80 characters.

As long as you have your primary keyword visible in the title, you will be
relevant to shoppers no matter where they search. Having your important
keywords in your title itself gives you an edge over your competitors.

  * **Bullet points**  

Amazon provides you 5 bullet points with a 100 character limit for each
bullet. Using the entire space provided to you is very important. You should
[write your bullet points in a way that you get all your profitable keywords
](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-bullet-points/)in a way that it reads
well and entices the reader to make a purchase.

![adding keywords in product

  * **Description**  

Most customers do not go so down the product listing page. Most of them do not
even read the description. And if they do, they might be looking for some
additional information about the product. But description has a weight in
Amazon’s algorithm. Use your most profitable keywords to write a proper
description of your product. As a lot of space is provided to add the
description, you can use some other less-profitable keywords too.

Free Tool: [Product Description Editor ](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-
product-description-editor.html)

![best example for amazon product description

  * **Reviews**  

Most sellers do not know how to use their customer review section to improve
their Amazon product listing. You can’t control the words that your customers
use while writing the review, but you can control the keywords that you use
while responding to the views.

![respond to review with answer with
keywords](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![respond

  * **Q &A**

![response to question with
keywords](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![response
to question with
keywords](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jJhzPgCXJ3jvHzqGqAhByy_WX84IbzfLcw68C5F1Vo2YjSX3VcKjMglSAHfLpl90UM1h5JJ8z_6PqBw1rwn2wHLgVgQOVhltK6XnTpbJWugxJHBVYHw79GGNnC8y1MVjLft54vln)

Customers can use the question section of your Amazon listing to ask you and
others questions about your product. You should answer your customer’s
questions and use your profitable keywords in your answers. Also, some of the
answers can be added as part of the description or bullet point also!

  * **Amazon Backend Search Terms**

You should insert all of your profitable keywords into the keyword section of
your product listings back end. You should also insert any other words that
describe your product.

**_Note: For a primer on how to optimize Backend search keywords, please refer
to SellerApp’s Blog on[Amazon Backend
Keywords](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-backend-keywords/)_**

  * **The image alt tags**  

This is another extremely non utilized Amazon Keyword Optimization technique.
Alt tags are basically small captions that you can write under the images of
your product. This is a great place to [utilize your profitable
keywords](https://www.sellerapp.com/amazon-keyword-search.html).

![Keyword In Amazon Product Image ALT

## Additional Areas of Amazon Product Listing Improvement

  * Brand and [Manufacturer Number](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-manufacturer-part-number/)  

The brand sells and there’s no doubt about it. Thus it should be mentioned in
the title thereby letting your product be listed based on the brand as well as
be eligible for search filters.

  * Use of Images  

The better you can see it on screen the better the chances of engaging and
converting a potential customer. It is a [must to use a high-resolution
image](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/amazon-product-photography/), of a
minimum of 1000 x 1000 px. This is essential to zoom the image. The improper
image can be one of the reasons for which the search can be suppressed.

Multiple images from different angles should be used if they afford different
details, however, if the case is otherwise, not having a lot of isn’t really
something that contributes negatively, but the images strictly must be of good
quality. In any case, having too many images reduces the
[returns](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/how-to-turn-amazon-customer-returns-
into-profit/).

Additional Resource: [Adding Videos On Amazon Product Listing
](https://www.sellerapp.com/help/article/add-video-amazon-listing/)

  * FBA

Without having to think much over it, Fulfillment by Amazon sounds positive in
itself and a good thing to have. Though in the ranking fulfillment, [Amazon
does not consider FBA](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/fba-amazon/), but FBA
contributes to a lot of other factors like the processing speed and
reliability of shipping. Thus having an FBA improves the actors of this kind.

Additional Resource For [Fulfillment By Amazon
](https://www.sellerapp.com/blog/fulfillment-by-amazon/)

  * Keywords 

Using the keywords efficiently is one of the most powerful ways of boosting
product visibility and sales. Despite sounding as easy putting significant
keywords at apparent good places to put them, it is generally not the case.
Very different keywords that do not actually describe the product can be
bringing people to your product page.
