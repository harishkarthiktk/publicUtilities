# Example Users Configuration
# This file demonstrates two ways to structure users in YAML

# Method 1: Using 'users' key (recommended for clarity)
users:
  admin: admin_password
  user1: user1_password
  user2: user2_password
  developer: dev_secure_password

# Method 2: Flat structure (alternative format)
# Simply remove the 'users:' key and use usernames directly
# admin: admin_password
# user1: user1_password
# user2: user2_password

# Notes:
# - Keep passwords secure; consider using environment variables instead
# - In production, use hashed passwords with bcrypt or Argon2
# - Do not commit this file with real credentials to version control
# - Use environment variables for sensitive data in production
