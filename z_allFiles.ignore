## README.md
# Consolidated Information
Random utilities that I have written for various functions
# Flask File Server
A self-hosted Flask-based utility for quickly transferring files between machines without needing to set up FTP or SMB shares.
---
## Current Features
- **File Browser UI**: Explore folder structure starting from a configurable `serveFolder`
- **Folder Support**: Nested directories are rendered and navigable
- **File Download**: Any listed file can be downloaded via the web UI
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Upload single files or entire folder structures
- **Basic Security**: Prevents directory traversal and unauthorized filesystem access
- **Temp Zip Cleanup**: Folders downloaded as ZIPs are auto-cleaned after delivery
- **File Filtering**: Only files with safe extensions (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`, etc.) are accepted during upload
---
## Upcoming Features: Admin Info
> (Planned section to appear at bottom of UI)
- **Total file count**
- **Total storage used**
- **Lifespan indicators** for uploaded files (e.g., "uploaded 3 hours ago")
---
## Planned Security Features
- **Access Token in URL** (e.g. `/?token=abc123`)
- **Optional Upload Password**
- **Rate Limiting or Time-Boxed Access**
- **Access logs and audit trail** (optional)
---
## Planned Functional Features
- **Select and Download Multiple Files as a ZIP**
- **Unzip Uploaded ZIP Archives Automatically**
- **QR Code for easy access from mobile devices**
- **Auto-delete old files** (based on file age or max count)
- **Pagination** of the list when the files and folders in the served folder becomes lot.
- **Search** functionality of quickly finding the file/path being searched in the entire listing.
---
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishkarthiktk/flask-file-server.git
cd flask-file-server
```
2. Create environment & install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the app:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
---
## Configuration
Edit these in `app.py` if needed:
| Variable       | Purpose                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `SERVE_FOLDER` | Root directory to serve files from |
| `UPLOAD_FOLDER`| Where uploads get stored        |
| `TEMP_DIR`     | Folder used to store temp zips  |
| `port`         | Port number (default `8000`)     |
| `host`         | Set to `0.0.0.0` to allow LAN access |
---
## API Endpoints
| Method | Path                       | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`                        | Show browser UI with files       |
| GET    | `/files/<path>`           | Download single file             |
| GET    | `/download-folder/<path>` | Download folder as ZIP           |
| POST   | `/upload`                 | Upload files/folders             |
---
## Considerations
- This is a utility, not a hardened production tool
- Great for LAN use, secure behind firewall/VPN
- Avoid exposing it directly to the internet without hardening
# Sansio
This folder contains code that can be used by alternative Flask
implementations, for example Quart. The code therefore cannot do any
IO, nor be part of a likely IO path. Finally this code cannot use the
Flask globals.
# parseContentGPT
## Purpose
I often need to clean and structure messy text content, like web-scraped data, for my knowledge base. 
While I could manually edit each file, why not have gpt do it for me?
This tool uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to intelligently parse text files, 
    removing garbage content and formatting the output as clean markdown.
## Usage
```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FOLDER, --folder FOLDER
                        Input folder containing .txt/.md files (default: ./input)
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save processed files (default: ./outputs)
  -w WORKERS, --workers WORKERS
                        Maximum concurrent API requests (default: 3)
```
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key (stored in system keyring)
- Required packages: `openai`, `keyring`, `tqdm`
## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Store your OpenAI API key:
Obtain your API Key for ChatGPT.
```bash
python -c "import keyring; keyring.set_password('OpenAI', 'api_key', 'your-api-key-here')"
```
## Disclaimer
This tool uses the OpenAI API which may have content moderation policies and usage limits. The quality of output depends on GPT-4's capabilities and may require manual verification. Be mindful of:
- API costs (charged per request). The default model being used is gpt-4.1-nano, which I find to be extremely effective.
- You can change the model at your own risk and need, if the content size exceeds as what the nano model can work with.
- Content ownership of processed files.
- Potential hallucinations or errors in AI processing.
Use responsibly and verify critical outputs. The liability of tool usage lies with the user themselves.

# pageDownloads
## Purpose
I often need to save webpages locally to augment to my knowledge base.
The most straight forward way of doing it is by downloading it as html using the browser's save-as functionality.
But being a programmer, we will spend an hour building tools to do an activity that would have taken a few minutes.
## Usage
options:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to a text file with URLs, one per line.
  -u URL, --url URL     A single URL to process.
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save the output files.
```
## Disclaimer
Web scrapping and downloading of files might be in breach of T&C of the targeted websites, and this tool is strictly for personal use.
Use with caution and ethical considerations, and the liability of the tool usage lies with the user themselves.

## Purpose
I often need to save webpages locally to augment to my knowledge base.
The most straight forward way of doing it is by downloading it as html using the browser's save-as functionality.
But being a programmer, we will spend an hour building tools to do an activity that would have taken a few minutes.
## Usage
options:
```
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to a text file with URLs, one per line.
  -u URL, --url URL     A single URL to process.
  -o OUTPUT_FOLDER, --output-folder OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        Folder to save the output files.
```
## Disclaimer
Web scrapping and downloading of files might be in breach of T&C of the targeted websites, and this tool is strictly for personal use.
Use with caution and ethical considerations, and the liability of the tool usage lies with the user themselves.

## 1\. Target keywords
Amazon uses keywords to rank your products in the right search results. It’s
important that you choose appropriate keywords for your listings. You want
your products to appear in search results that are relevant.
If you use search engine optimization (SEO) or invest in [SEO
services](https://www.webfx.com/seo/services/) for your website, you may be
familiar with conducting keyword research. [Keyword
research](https://www.webfx.com/seo/learn/how-to-do-keyword-research/) for
Amazon operates differently. Google SEO focuses more on optimizing listings to
help users find information, while Amazon focuses on optimizing listings to
get people to buy products.
To find the right keywords, use an Amazon-specific keyword research tool.
[Sonar](http://sonar-tool.com/us/) is a great tool to use to find Amazon
keywords for your listings. In addition, you can come up with base keywords
for your listings and type them into Amazon’s search bar to get suggestions
for expanding on those keywords.
![amazon sonar](https://www.webfx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-
sonar.png)
Once you figure out your keywords, integrate them into your listing. You only
need to integrate each keyword once to rank for it. Put your most important
keyword in your title.
You’ll want to put your second and third most important keywords in your
product descriptions. Any other keywords can go into the backend of your
listing. Your backend keywords will still allow your listings to rank in the
search results but won’t bog them down with too many keywords.
Choosing the right keywords will help you optimize your listings to reach
valuable leads. It’s a great way to get your products to appear in multiple,
relevant search results.
## 2\. Optimize your listing titles
Your title is one of the first things your audience will see when they find
your listing. It’s important to optimize your titles so you can provide your
audience with valuable information. You want to provide them with information
that gets them to click on your listing.
For most categories, there is a [limit of 200
characters](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200390640),
which includes spaces. Some categories of products allow for even less
characters.
So, what type of information should be in your title?
![amazon title optimization](https://www.webfx.com/wp-
content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-title-optimization.png)
Here’s a general format to follow for your product titles:
[Brand] [Feature] [Material] [Key ingredient] [Product type] [Model number]
[Size] [Package count] [Color] [Flavor]
While it isn’t required that you include all this information, it gives you an
idea for how to format your title.
The first thing in your title should be the brand name. People are drawn to
product listings that put the brand name first, especially if your brand is
well-known to people. It will help people feel confident about buying your
products because they know they are associated with a specific brand.
You’ll also want to integrate your most important keyword into your titles.
Your audience will see this keyword and determine if your products are
relevant to their needs.
In addition, you’ll want to include information like your product name,
quantity, and other important features of your product. This information
should help your audience understand more about your products and entice them
to click on your listings.
When you optimize your product titles, think about features that accentuate
the value of your products. Features like the material, being eco-friendly, or
color can influence your audience to check out your listings.
Optimizing your product page titles will help you drive better results for
your listings. You’ll encourage more leads to check out your listings by
providing them with important details in your titles.
## 3\. Use quality images
Next to your title, your images are one of the elements your audience uses to
judge your product. It’s important that you put the right images in your
product listings to give your audience a visual perception of your products.
All images uploaded to your Amazon listings should be at least 1000 pixels by
1000 pixels. You want to upload high-resolution images, so your audience can
zoom in and get a better view of your products.
There are specific requirements for your main images:
  1. **Professional image:** Your main image should be a professional photo that showcases the product.
  2. **Focus on the product:** Your product should fill the majority of the frame and the background should be white.
  3. **No markings:** There should be no watermarks, additional text, or anything that takes away from the product. The main image should solely showcase the product to your audience.
Aside from the main image, you have free rein over your eight other images.
This is an opportunity for you to show your audience all angles of your
product. It’s a great way to give your audience different points of view.
You can also take images that show your products in use or show the scale of
your product. These are both great images to help your audience better
understand your products.
Choosing the right images will help you better optimize your product listings.
You’ll get your audience interested in your products and help them decide
whether to convert.
## 4\. Optimize your product features section
When you see an Amazon listing, there is a bulleted list that appears at the
top of the product pages. This is your product features section. It is an
important section for helping your business showcase the important aspects of
your product.
![amazon product features section](https://www.webfx.com/wp-
content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-product-features-section.png)
In this section, list the most important features of your product. What
information matters to your audience? You can list information like what your
product can do, how it works, different features it offers, warranties, and
guarantees.
This is another place where you can incorporate keywords, too. This will help
you appear in relevant search results for important keywords.
## 5\. Optimize your product descriptions
If your audience is really interested in your products, they’re going to head
to the product descriptions to learn more about them. Take the time to fill
out the product descriptions and provide your audience with additional details
about your products.
This is where you can tell your audience why they need to buy your products.
Emphasize the value and show them why your products are the solution to their
problem. You want to make your audience feel like they need to buy your
products.
When you write your product description, keep it casual and relatable for your
audience. Integrate target keywords to help your page rank for other relevant
keywords. A good description will help you provide that final nudge to get
leads to convert.
## 6\. Set the right price
Pricing plays an important role in your business earning conversions. Amazon
uses your pricing to predict how your products will perform.
When users shop on Amazon, they want to get the best deal. If your products
are priced higher than the other selection of products, they are more likely
to choose the cheaper option – especially if the star rating is the same! You
don’t want to miss out on sales because your product isn’t priced like your
competitors’.
![amazon pricing example](https://www.webfx.com/wp-
content/uploads/2021/11/amazon-pricing-example.png)
For instance, if you list your product for $70 and your competitors list their
similar product around $30, Amazon will rank your product lower because it
predicts that your product won’t earn as many conversions as your
competitors’.
Does this mean you need to alter your pricing? Not entirely. Research your
competition to see how your prices compare to theirs. If you have room to
adjust your price, it is beneficial, but you can also improve your listings by
choosing different keywords to appear in better results.
## 7\. Earn reviews
Reviews are a crucial part of your product listings’ rankings. Amazon is very
focused on reviews because they know that good reviews encourage people to
convert. Since Amazon is in the business of sales, they focus on boosting
product listings that have good reviews to sell them.
Amazon ranks products at the top of the search results that have 4 or more
stars, so it’s ideal to have a relatively high rating. These products
encourage conversions because others have had a good experience with the
products.
Previously, companies would use incentives to encourage their audience to
review their product on Amazon. Now, Amazon restricts what you can do to [earn
reviews for your products](https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/how-to-get-
reviews-on-amazon/). These restrictions push you to earn organic and authentic
reviews from people who have previously purchase your product.
To ensure you receive reviews, encourage your customers to review your
products when they purchase them. You can do this through an automated [email
marketing campaign](https://www.webfx.com/email-marketing/services/). Send
emails to your customers and invite them to share their experience.
When you ask for reviews, there’s a possibility that you will receive a
mixture of positive and negative reviews. The negative reviews are an
opportunity for you to solve problems or improve your product.
Potential buyers want to see that you are willing to fix issues people have
with your products. It may even encourage people to change their reviews to a
more positive rating!
Reviews will help you better optimize your product pages. You can appear
higher in search results by obtaining positive reviews.

Hello, I'm Emma Schermer Tamir! By day I'm the CEO & Co-founder of Marketing
by Emma. Always, I'm insatiably curious free spirit and a voracious learner.
Since 2016, my partner and husband, Erez, my team, and I have had the
privilege to help over 1,000 businesses from around the world boost their
sales and build their brands online. Through our thoughtful approach and
winning strategies, I've also had the incredible fortune of become a leading
expert in the field of selling on Amazon. Whether speaking on stages across
the globe, leading our team, or working with clients, my goal is to empower
everyone to create better product pages, Amazon listings, and website copy
that makes brands' dream customers excited to click "Add to Cart!” With this
channel I hope to touch on topics of e-commerce marketing, Amazon listing
optimization, entrepreneurship, tools, systems, personal development, and so
much more. If you have a topic idea, please share!

Amazon listing optimization requires knowledge about Amazon SEO strategy,
design, copywriting, buyer behavior, branding, the culture, the platform, TOS,
and on, and on, and on. I've been helping e-commerce businesses maximize their
Amazon listing and SEO since 2016. I've seen a lot of things change, from
enhanced brand content to A+ Content and A+ Premium Content, Brand Stories and
Storefronts, and more. I've watched the competition get fiercer and the rules
get harder. Today I'm sharing some of my top Amazon FBA product listing
optimization secrets that I've honed from reviewing over 8,000 listings. Want
me to dish more of my secrets? Let me know in the comments and I'll create a

When done right, Amazon search engine optimization (SEO) can be a win-win for
sellers and customers alike. Effective optimization can boost sales while
helping shoppers find the products they want. This guide will cover:  
  * What Amazon SEO is
  * How SEO works in the Amazon store
  * Ways to improve your rankings
## What is Amazon SEO and why does it matter?
Amazon search engine optimization (SEO) refers to a number of strategies you
can use to improve product and brand visibility in Amazon search results. For
example, you can conduct keyword research and add search terms to product
titles and descriptions. You can also tweak photos and adjust price points to
organically move up in search results and generate more sales.
Let’s dive into the details of how to improve your selling potential and
connect with more customers through SEO.
## How Amazon SEO works: 5 components
Here’s a quick overview of how customers find products in the Amazon store.
### 1\. Amazon search box
Customers find products by typing a term or phrase into the Amazon search box
and browsing through results. There’s also a drop-down menu of departments
like **Pet Supplies** and **Sports & Outdoors**.
Did you know?
Anyone can use Amazon SEO to grow sales
You don’t need to be a search optimization specialist to take your sales to
the next level. All Amazon sellers, [including
resellers](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/reselling) and [brand
owners](https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry), can use keyword research and
other SEO methods to optimize product listings and drive sales.  
If you enrolled a brand in [Amazon Brand
Registry](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry)—a free
resource to help build and protect your brand—you can also access [advanced
SEO resources](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/brand-analytics) like the [Search
Query
Performance](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/G8J4CB5ZBF3NX7TP?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo) dashboard and [Top Search
Terms](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G5NXWNY8HUD3VDCW?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo) dashboard.

](https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#selling-plans)
### 2\. Search filters
Customers refine a search by using different filters like delivery day,
customer reviews, and price. The Amazon homepage also has links to [Best
Sellers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/?ref_=nav_em_cs_bestsellers_0_1_1_2&initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo), [New Releases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/new-
releases/?ref_=nav_em_cs_newreleases_0_1_1_3&initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo), [Movers & Shakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-
shakers/?ref_=nav_em_ms_0_1_1_4&initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo), and other collections.
### 3\. Search results page
The Amazon search engine results page shows product offers to customers so
they can compare prices, shipping options, and other factors.
### 4\. Amazon sales rank
The [Amazon Best Sellers list](https://www.amazon.com/Best-
Sellers/zgbs?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo) shows the most popular products in the Amazon store based on real-time
sales. [Best Sellers Rank](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-best-sellers-
rank) is a metric that indicates how well a product is selling within featured
categories.
### 5\. Sponsored Products and advertising
Cost-per-click ads like [Sponsored
Products](https://sell.amazon.com/advertising/sponsored-products) and other
forms of [ecommerce marketing](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/ecommerce-
marketing) can help offers rise through search results, stand apart from the
competition, and capture the attention of customers.

Listing quality and your account health can contribute to search rankings
After you sign up for an Amazon selling account, [dashboards in your Seller
Central account](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/amazon-seller-dashboard) will
give you performance insights and recommendations for making improvements to
your listings, account health, and other areas like [inventory

## 7 ways to improve search rankings and boost sales
### 1\. Conduct keyword research
What words and phrases are customers using to find products like the ones you
offer? Which keywords should you be targeting in your product titles,
descriptions, and ads in order to drive sales? Do some keyword research to
find out.
There are many different ways to perform keyword research. Here are a few
strategies:  
  * Type a variety of keywords into the [Amazon search box](https://www.amazon.com?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-seo). Mine the suggestions in the drop-down menu for ideas, then compile a comprehensive list of keywords that could be valuable for your offers.
  * Take a look at your competition. Scan competitor offers for words and phrases that might enhance your content.
  * Use SEO tools to dig into keywords, discover related phrases, explore demand, and find data to guide your strategy. [Product Opportunity Explorer](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/product-opportunity-explorer) is one tool you can use to identify top search terms and trends in Amazon customer search volume.
While performing research, think in terms of “short-tail” and “long-tail”
keywords.  
  * Short-tail refers to words and phrases that tend to be broad in terms of search intent, such as “furniture” or “shoes.” They might have high search volumes along with high competition.
  * Long-tail refers to a more specific words and phrases like “water resistant lawn furniture” or “vegan leather brown loafers.” These queries might be less popular, but they could enjoy higher sales conversion rates because their search intent is more specific.
Try to use a mix of short- and long-tail keywords in your product content.
Remember, short-tail keywords can have high visibility but might be harder to
rank for, while long-tail phrases might increase conversions but have lower
search volumes.
Pro Tip
Use Amazon keyword research tools
When optimizing for search, data and analytics on customer search behavior can
give you a leg up. You can get insights into target keywords by using tools
like [Product Opportunity Explorer](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/product-
opportunity-explorer)**,** which provides up-to-date data on trends in
customer search patterns, product demand, and profitable niches.  
Another great option for keyword research available to enrolled brands is
[Amazon Brand Analytics](https://sell.amazon.com/blog/brand-analytics), which
contains a collection of dashboards for exploring aggregate customer search
and purchasing data. For instance, the [Search Query
Performance](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G8J4CB5ZBF3NX7TP?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo) dashboard shows the top queries leading customers to your brand, along
with metrics for impressions, clicks, cart adds, and more. **__**
[ Learn more about Brand Analytics ](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/amazon-
brand-analytics)
### 2\. Craft high-performing product titles
Product titles are a great place to use the primary keywords you identify
through your keyword research.
To craft concise and compelling titles, put yourself in the customer’s shoes
and think about the most important details they want to know. The product
title is an appropriate place to highlight:  
  * Product type
  * Brand name
  * Descriptive information like color or size
For example, the title “Good Sleep Collection, Pillow Cases (Blue, Set of 2)”
will likely perform better than “Blue Pillow Cases” because it includes the
brand name (Good Sleep) and product line (Premium Collection) along with
details about the material and other key attributes.
Keep in mind the Amazon product title character limit is 200, and we recommend
no more than 60. Include only the most important keywords to capture the
attention of your intended customer. Don’t worry—you’ll have a chance to add
more keywords in other parts of the [product detail
page](https://sell.amazon.com/sell#product-detail-page) like the product
description, which we’ll cover next.
Pro Tip
**Test different keywords with Manage Your Experiments to improve sales**
Manage Your Experiments allows brands enrolled in [Amazon Brand
Registry](https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry) to run A/B tests comparing
two versions of a product title, image, description, or other content types in
order to find out what resonates more with customers.  
For example, you might find that a short product title performs better than a
long product title.
[ Learn more about Manage Your Experiments
](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/manage-your-experiments)
### 3\. Create informative product descriptions
The product description is an opportunity to use secondary keywords to expand
on features and benefits, helping customers find and evaluate your products.
Here are some examples of the types of details you might want to mention in a
product description:  
  * Materials
  * Colors
  * Quantities
  * Sizes
  * Dimensions
  * Care instructions
  * Warranty information
Have you heard of keyword stuffing? It refers to repeating or overusing
keywords in an effort to help a product rank in search results. Keyword
stuffing can create a poor customer experience and hurt your rankings.
Instead, focus on writing naturally and provide the information your audience
is seeking.
Here’s a good rule of thumb for product descriptions: if you use a key phrase
once, you probably don’t need to use it again. Refer to your research and try
to use keyword variations, weaving in as many valuable phrases as possible
while ensuring they make sense in context

pages](https://youtu.be/a2FB6PUKpWc?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo)
Pro Tip
Bring products to life with A+ Content
A+ Content is**** an advanced option for adding rich text, images, videos, and
product-comparison charts to your product detail pages. A+ Content can help
increase sales and is free for brands enrolled in [Amazon Brand
Registry](https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry).
[ Learn more about A+ Content ](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/a-content)
### **4\. Highlight key details with bullet points**
The bullet point section on a product detail page can be another opportunity
to use keywords effectively, balance the level of detail you’re providing, and
enhance the customer experience.
When crafting bullet points for product page, choose the most important
details you want to stand out. Highlight a product’s design, illustrate
special features, or explain unique uses. Think about it from the customer’s
point of view and highlight related terms or features they might be looking
for in the product.
When formatting bullet points, start with a one- or two-word description, then
offer an explanation in 100 characters or fewer. Use fragments (no need for
full sentences) and capitalize the first letter of each bullet. Using these
[tips to craft great bullet
points](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GX5L8BF8GLMML6CX?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo) can help your product stand out to customers.
### 5\. Add back-end search terms
You can add keywords to a product’s catalog data. These keywords are not
visible to customers, but they can still help a product rank for specific
searches.
To add search terms for a product:  
  * Log in to your Amazon Seller Central account.
  * Under **Inventory** in the main menu, go to **Manage All Inventory.**
  * Find the listing where you want to add backend keywords and click **Edit**.
  * Click the **Product details** tab.
  * Enter your keywords in the **Generic keyword** field.
Use this section as a spillover for keywords you want to include if you run
out of room or if they don’t fit naturally in other parts of the product
detail page. Include synonyms, abbreviations, and alternative names for
products, but avoid redundant or irrelevant terms.
When entering back-end keywords, use all lowercase letters and separate words
with spaces only. You can also skip articles and prepositions.
[Learn more about using search terms
effectively](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G23501?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo)
### 6\. Showcase high-quality product images
Images can convey key information about a product to customers that can be
difficult to communicate with words alone. Use the following best practices
for product photography:  
  * Include a variety of shots showing the product from different angles.
  * Highlight key features.
  * Make sure images are clear, focused, and well-lit.
  * Use plain white backgrounds.
  * Have the product fill 85% or more of the frame.
Research best practices for professional product photography based on the type
of product you want to offer, such as
[clothing](https://sell.amazon.com/sell/clothes) or
[jewelry](https://sell.amazon.com/sell/jewelry).
When adding images to your product detail pages, make sure you’re [making the
most of the “alt-
text”](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G202134820?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-
seo), which provides another opportunity to optimize SEO and help your product
appear in search results. Alt-text isn’t visible on the product detail page,
but it describes the image to visually impaired customers and is ranked by
search engines. Alt-text should be a simple sentence describing the image that
includes 1-2 keywords.
### 7\. Adjust product prices to drive sales
Adjusting your list price to stay competitive can improve your product ranking
and increase sales. To find your pricing sweet spot, try the following:  
  * Consider your costs (including shipping costs) and calculate your margins to make sure you can make a profit. The [Revenue Calculator](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GWYBC38TZGCUNRKW?initialSessionID=142-7292108-6302140&ld=SDUSSOADirect&pageName=US%3ASD%3Ablog%2Famazon-seo) can help you estimate profits and margins for a products by fulfillment method.
  * Research your competitors. Take a look at prices for similar products to get a sense for the range of appropriate price points.

prices across your inventory.

# 7 Amazon Product Page Optimization Tips
Amazon is one of the fastest-growing online platforms for selling your products. If you want to reach as many leads as possible, optimize your product listings on Amazon. On this page, we’ll provide you with seven Amazon product page optimization tips to help you improve your product listings. If you need help creating more effective product listings, [contact us online](https://www.webfx.com/free-quote/) or call us today at **[888-601-5359](tel:8886015359)** to learn how our team of experts can help you improve your product pages.
[Calculate Your Amazon Sales Margin](https://www.webfx.com/tools/amazon-sales-margin-calculator/)
## 1. Target keywords
Amazon uses keywords to rank your products in the right search results. It’s important that you choose appropriate keywords for your listings. You want your products to appear in search results that are relevant.
To find the right keywords, use an Amazon-specific keyword research tool like [Sonar](http://sonar-tool.com/us/). Once you figure out your keywords, integrate them into your listing. You only need to integrate each keyword once to rank for it. Put your most important keyword in your title.
## 2. Optimize your listing titles
Your title is one of the first things your audience will see when they find your listing. It’s important to optimize your titles so you can provide your audience with valuable information. You want to provide them with information that gets them to click on your listing.
For most categories, there is a [limit of 200 characters](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200390640), which includes spaces. The first thing in your title should be the brand name. You’ll also want to integrate your most important keyword into your titles.
## 3. Use quality images
Next to your title, your images are one of the elements your audience uses to judge your product. It’s important that you put the right images in your product listings to give your audience a visual perception of your products.
All images uploaded to your Amazon listings should be at least 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels. You want to upload high-resolution images, so your audience can zoom in and get a better view of your products.
## 4. Optimize your product features section
In this section, list the most important features of your product. What information matters to your audience? You can list information like what your product can do, how it works, different features it offers, warranties, and guarantees.
## 5. Optimize your product descriptions
If your audience is really interested in your products, they’re going to head to the product descriptions to learn more about them. Take the time to fill out the product descriptions and provide your audience with additional details about your products.
## 6. Set the right price
Pricing plays an important role in your business earning conversions. Amazon uses your pricing to predict how your products will perform. Research your competition to see how your prices compare to theirs. If you have room to adjust your price, it is beneficial.
## 7. Earn reviews
Reviews are a crucial part of your product listings’ rankings. Amazon ranks products at the top of the search results that have 4 or more stars. To ensure you receive reviews, encourage your customers to review your products when they purchase them.
