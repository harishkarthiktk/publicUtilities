# Consolidated Information

Random utilities that I have written for various functions


# pageDownloads

## Purpose
I often need to save webpages locally to augment to my knowledge base.
The most straight forward way of doing it is by downloading it as html using the browser's save-as functionality.

But being a programmer, we will spend an hour building tools to do an activity that would have taken a few minutes.

## Usage

## Disclaimer
Web scrapping and downloading of files might be in breach of T&C of the targeted websites, and this tool is strictly for personal use.
Use with caution and ethical considerations, and the liability of the tool usage lies with the user themselves.
